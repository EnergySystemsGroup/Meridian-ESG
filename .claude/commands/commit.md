Commit the staged changes or all recent changes with a descriptive commit message.

Rules:
1. Do NOT include the Claude Code signature or "Generated with Claude Code" line
2. Do NOT include "Co-Authored-By" lines
3. Use conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, chore:, refactor:, docs:, etc.)
4. Write a concise summary on the first line
5. Add bullet points for details if there are multiple changes

If no files are staged, stage the relevant changed files first
