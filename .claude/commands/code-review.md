Before we commit, do a code review on the recent implementation. Without losing functionality:

1. Look for superfluous or redundant code
2. Identify any dead code (unused variables, functions, imports)
3. Verify file architecture is sound
4. Check for leftover debug code that should be removed

Only suggest meaningful changes - no petty or unnecessary modifications. Focus on things that actually matter for code quality and maintainability.
