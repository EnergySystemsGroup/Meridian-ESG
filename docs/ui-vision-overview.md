# UI Vision Overview for Policy & Funding Intelligence System

This document outlines the UI vision for the policy and funding intelligence system, designed to help users track, identify, and manage funding opportunities and legislative changes relevant to energy efficiency, building modernization, and related fields.

## Core UI Principles

- **Data-Rich, Not Data-Heavy**: Present complex information in digestible formats
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Surface key information first, with details available on demand
- **Contextual Actions**: Provide relevant actions based on the current view and selected items
- **Consistent Patterns**: Use consistent UI patterns across the application
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure usability across desktop and tablet devices

## Key UI Components

### 1. Dashboard Home

The dashboard home provides an at-a-glance view of the most important information:

- **Summary Cards**: Key metrics like total available funding, open opportunities, upcoming deadlines
- **Opportunity Pipeline**: Visual representation of funding opportunities by stage (anticipated, open, closing soon)
- **Activity Feed**: Recent system updates, new opportunities, legislation changes
- **Calendar Preview**: Upcoming deadlines and important dates
- **Quick Filters**: Ability to filter the entire dashboard by service area, client type, geography

### 2. Map Visualization

The map view visualizes the geographic distribution of funding:

- **Interactive US Map**: Color-coded by funding density with state/region selection
- **Layered Data Visualization**: Toggle between different data layers (federal funding, state programs, client locations)
- **Detail Panel**: When a state is selected, show detailed breakdown of opportunities
- **Filtering Controls**: Filter by funding type, amount, deadline, etc.

### 3. Opportunity Explorer

A dedicated view for browsing and filtering funding opportunities:

- **Detail View**: Expandable rows or side panel for detailed information
- **Advanced Filters**: Filter by funding source, amount, deadline, eligibility, etc.
- **Saved Searches**: Allow users to save common filters
- **Export Options**: Export filtered results to CSV/PDF

### 4. Legislative Tracker

A view focused on monitoring relevant legislation:

- **Status Board**: Kanban-style board showing legislation by stage
- **Timeline View**: Chronological view of legislative events
- **Bill Details**: Expandable view showing full details of selected legislation

### 5. Timeline View

A chronological view of important dates:
