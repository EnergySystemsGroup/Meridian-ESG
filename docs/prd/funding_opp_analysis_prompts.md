## Funding Opportunity Analysis Prompts

### 1. Program Overview
Based on this funding opportunity, write a 2-3 sentence program overview that serves as an elevator pitch. 

First sentence: State what it funds, the award amount range, and who can apply.
Second sentence: Highlight the unique strategic value and most compelling benefit (e.g., no match required, fast turnaround, etc.).

Keep it under 75 words total. Focus on what makes this worth pursuing, not general description.

Example format:
"California's rubberized pavement grant provides $375K-$750K to cities, counties, and state agencies for road resurfacing projects using recycled tire rubber. Aligns perfectly with sustainable infrastructure goals while addressing routine road maintenance needs—no cost share required."

### 2. Program Use Cases
List 3-4 specific, concrete use cases where clients would be strong candidates for this funding. Focus on real scenarios our clients face.

For each use case, write one sentence that includes:
- The client type/situation
- The specific problem they're solving
- How this funding addresses it

Format as a bulleted list. Be specific—avoid generic statements.

Example:
- A school district with deteriorating asphalt playgrounds can replace them with permeable surfaces while adding green space
- A city public works department facing deferred maintenance on parking lots can modernize with sustainable materials
- A community college needing to meet MS4 permit requirements can retrofit large parking areas with drainage systems

### 3. Application Summary
Provide a concise summary of the application process and key strategic considerations. Include:

- Basic process steps (1-2 sentences)
- Timeline from start to award
- Most important requirement or scoring factor
- One key tip for success

Keep to 4-5 sentences maximum. Focus on what applicants need to know to decide if they should pursue this.

Avoid generic advice. Be specific to THIS program's requirements and evaluation criteria.

### 4. Program Insights
Identify 2-3 important details about this program that aren't obvious from the basic requirements but could impact an applicant's decision or strategy. 

These might include:
- Unusual restrictions or requirements
- Preferences not explicitly stated in scoring criteria
- Historical funding patterns or success factors
- Technical assistance availability
- Specific documentation challenges

Write as 2-3 bullet points, one sentence each. Only include genuinely useful insights, not standard requirements.

Example:
- Projects in disadvantaged communities receive automatic 10% scoring bonus and priority review
- Technical assistance includes free feasibility studies worth up to $50K through separate program
- Agencies can submit multiple applications but each requires separate community support letters
