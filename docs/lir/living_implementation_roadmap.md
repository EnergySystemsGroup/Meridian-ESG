## Funding API Processing System

<a id="funding-api-overview"></a>

### Overview

The Funding API Processing System is designed to retrieve, filter, and store funding opportunities from external APIs. It employs a flexible approach to handle both single-API and two-step API sources, using LLM-powered analysis to identify the most relevant opportunities for clients.

**Key Features:**

- Configurable API source integration
- LLM-powered filtering of opportunities
- Two-stage processing flow for detailed opportunity analysis
- Adaptive batch processing for efficient resource management
- Structured data storage with normalization
- Detailed execution tracking and logging
- Support for multiple opportunity sources and APIs

<a id="funding-api-decisions"></a>

### Notable Design Decisions

- **Agent-Based Architecture**: System uses specialized agents (Source Manager, API Handler, Detail Processor, Data Processor) with clear separation of concerns for different stages of the processing pipeline.

- **Two-Step Processing Model**: Implemented to efficiently process large volumes of opportunities, with an initial filter to quickly eliminate irrelevant items before detailed processing.

- **Run Manager Pattern**: Dedicated RunManager class manages state throughout processing pipeline, tracking status of every stage with detailed metrics.

- **Flexible Prompt Template System**: Uses LangChain PromptTemplate objects for structured LLM interaction, allowing for clear prompt management and formatting.

- **Batch Processing Strategy**: Opportunities are processed in batches with adaptive sizing based on token limits, ensuring efficient use of LLM resources.

- **Direct Data Processing Flow**: Eliminates intermediate database storage between processing stages, maintaining data in memory until final storage decisions are made, improving efficiency and reducing overhead.

- **Selective LLM Usage**: LLMs are used for complex filtering and analysis in early stages, with simpler rule-based processing for later stages like data storage, optimizing for both quality and efficiency.
