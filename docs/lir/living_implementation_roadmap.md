# Living Implementation Roadmap (LIR) - Funding Intelligence System

This document tracks the implementation status of all features in the Funding Intelligence System. It serves as both a living requirements document and an actionable project roadmap that evolves as development progresses.

## Next Tasks Priority

This section highlights the highest priority tasks to be completed next:

1. **Data Processor - Update Detection Improvement**: Verify and improve update detection logic to prevent false positives from minor LLM wording differences. Currently, opportunities may be incorrectly marked as "updated" when only the phrasing in description or summary fields has changed.

2. **Detail Processor - Adaptive Relevance Threshold**: Implement adaptive thresholds for relevance scores based on source quality and historical data.

3. **API Handler - Support for Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting and throttling capabilities to prevent API usage limits from being exceeded.

4. **Error Handling - Automatic Retry Mechanisms**: Implement automatic retry logic for transient failures in API calls.

5. **Admin Interface - Run Filtering and Search**: Add filtering and search capabilities to the runs listing interface.

## Funding API Processing System

<a id="funding-api-overview"></a>

### Overview

The Funding API Processing System is designed to retrieve, filter, and store funding opportunities from external APIs. It employs a flexible approach to handle both single-API and two-step API sources, using LLM-powered analysis to identify the most relevant opportunities for clients.

**Key Features:**

- Configurable API source integration
- LLM-powered filtering of opportunities
- Two-stage processing flow for detailed opportunity analysis
- Adaptive batch processing for efficient resource management
- Structured data storage with normalization
- Detailed execution tracking and logging
- Support for multiple opportunity sources and APIs

<a id="funding-api-decisions"></a>

### Notable Design Decisions

- **Agent-Based Architecture**: System uses specialized agents (Source Manager, API Handler, Detail Processor, Data Processor) with clear separation of concerns for different stages of the processing pipeline.

- **Two-Step Processing Model**: Implemented to efficiently process large volumes of opportunities, with an initial filter to quickly eliminate irrelevant items before detailed processing.

- **Run Manager Pattern**: Dedicated RunManager class manages state throughout processing pipeline, tracking status of every stage with detailed metrics.

- **Flexible Prompt Template System**: Uses LangChain PromptTemplate objects for structured LLM interaction, allowing for clear prompt management and formatting.

- **Batch Processing Strategy**: Opportunities are processed in batches with adaptive sizing based on token limits, ensuring efficient use of LLM resources.

- **Direct Data Processing Flow**: Eliminates intermediate database storage between processing stages, maintaining data in memory until final storage decisions are made, improving efficiency and reducing overhead.

- **Selective LLM Usage**: LLMs are used for complex filtering and analysis in early stages, with simpler rule-based processing for later stages like data storage, optimizing for both quality and efficiency.
