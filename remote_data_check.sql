Processes utilizing electrochemistry or photochemistry for sustainable energy and chemical production must be scalable, environmentally benign, reduce greenhouse gas production, and utilize renewable resources. Research projects that stress fundamental understanding of phenomena that directly impact key barriers to improved system or component-level performance (for example, energy efficiency, product yield, process intensification) are encouraged. Processes for energy storage should address fundamental research barriers for renewable electricity storage applications, for transport propulsion, or for other applications that could have impact towards climate change mitigation. For projects concerning energy storage materials, proposals should involve testable hypotheses that involve device or component performance characteristics that are tied to fundamental understanding of transport, kinetics, or thermodynamics. Advanced chemistries beyond lithium-ion are encouraged. Proposed research on processes utilizing electrochemistry or photochemistry should be inspired by the need for economic and impactful conversion processes.\n\r\n\nAll proposal project descriptions should address how the proposed work, if successful, will improve process realization and economic feasibility and compare the proposed work against current state of the art. Highly integrated multidisciplinary projects are encouraged. When appropriate, collaborations with industrial technologists are encouraged through GOALI proposals. Collaborative projects with an integrated experimental and theoretical approach are also encouraged.\n\r\n\nTopics of interest include electrochemical energy storage and electrochemical production/conversion systems. Radically new battery systems can move the U.S. more rapidly toward a more sustainable transportation future and to greater renewable electricity production penetration. High-energy density and high-power density batteries suitable for transportation and renewable energy storage applications are of primary interest. Advanced systems involving metal anodes, solid-state electrolytes, nonaqueous systemsbeyond lithium, aqueous systems beyond lithium,and multivalent chemistries are encouraged. Research activities focused on commercially available systems such as lead-acid and nickel-metal hydride batteries or lithium-ion batteries for medical or consumer electronics applications will not be considered by this program. Novel electrochemical and photochemical systems and processes for the production of chemicals and high-value products are encouraged. Emphasis is placed on those systems that improve process intensification and process modularization with accompanying benefits in energy efficiency and environmental footprint.\n\r\n\nAdditional fundamental science topics of interest to this program include the study of:\n\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>advanced fuel cell systems or fuel cell components for transportation propulsion or grid energy storage applications;</li>\r\n<li>flow batteries for stationary energy storage applications including alternative redox chemistries (e.g., organic, inorganic, organometallic, macromolecular) and operating strategies (e.g., redox-mediation, suspensions); and</li>\r\n<li>photocatalytic or photoelectrochemical processes and devices for the splitting of water into hydrogen gas or for the reduction of carbon dioxide to liquid or gaseous fuels. Projects that largely focus on developing fundamental understanding of the catalytic reaction mechanisms and structure-function relationships may be more appropriate as submissions to the CBET Catalysis program (CBET 1401).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\nProjects submitted to the Electrochemical Systems program are expected to develop fundamental, molecular-level understanding of the key chemical reaction and transport phenomena barriers to improved system-level performance. Innovative proposals outside of these specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.\n\r\n\nReferrals to other programs within NSF:\n\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Proposals that focus on electric-field driven separations such as dielectrophoresis should be directed to theInterfacial Engineeringprogram (CBET 1417).</li>\r\n<li>Proposals that focus on thermal management of energy storage devices and systems should be submitted to theThermal Transport Processesprogram (CBET 1406).</li>\r\n<li>Proposals that focus on improving device and system performance of primarily organic, inorganic, and hybrid photovoltaic (PV) technologies, including perovskites, may be more appropriate as submissions to the Electronics, Photonics, and Magnetic Devices program in Engineering''s Division of Electrical, Communications, and Cyber Systems (ECCS 1517). PV materials proposals that focus on the material science may be considered in the Division of Materials Research of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.</li>\r\n<li>Proposals that focus on the generation of thermal energy by solar radiation should be directed to theThermal Transport Processesprogram (CBET 1406).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\nINFORMATION COMMON TO MOST CBET PROGRAMS\n\r\n\nProposals should address the novelty and/or<a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/about/transformative_research/faq.jsp\">potentially transformative nature</a>of the proposed work compared to previous work in the field. Also, it is important to address why the proposed work is important in terms of engineering science, as well as to also project the potential impact on society and/or industry of success in the research. The novelty or potentially transformative nature of the research should be included, as a minimum, in the Project Summary of each proposal.\n\r\n\nThe duration of unsolicited proposal awards in CBET is generally up to three years. Single-investigator award budgets typically include support for one graduate student (or equivalent) and up to one month of principal investigator time per year(awards for multiple investigator projects are typically larger). Proposal budgets that are much larger than typical should be discussed with the Program Director prior to submission. Proposers can view budget amounts and other information from recent awards made by this program via the &ldquo;What Has Been Funded (Recent Awards Made Through This Program, with Abstracts)&rdquo; link towards the bottom of this page.\n\r\n\nFaculty Early Career Development(CAREER)program proposals are strongly encouraged. Award duration is five years.The submission deadline for Engineering CAREER proposals is in July every year. Learn more in the<a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/career\">CAREER program description</a>.\n\r\n\nProposals for Conferences, Workshops, and Supplements: PIs are strongly encouraged to discuss their requests with the Program Director before submission of the proposal.\n\r\n\nGrants forRapid Response Research(RAPID)andEArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research(EAGER)are also considered when appropriate.

The ECI program promotes research that can shape the future of the nation&rsquo;s physical civil infrastructure and that can contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation, and hazards and disaster resilience. Types of civil infrastructure that the ECI program considers include, but are not limited to, buildings, residential construction, earth and earth retaining structures, and components of flood protection systems; water, waste disposal, and wastewater systems; energy infrastructure (excluding nuclear); and transportation systems (excluding pavements). Both disciplinary and convergent research that can address the challenges of physical civil infrastructure to be resilient and sustainable over its service lifetime are of particular interest. Broader impacts of ECI research include fostering community welfare for an equitable and prosperous nation and promoting environmentally friendly, circular economy policies.\n\r\n\nThe ECI program supports research that advances knowledge on the behavior of physical civil infrastructure subjected to and interacting with the natural environment during construction; under service and long-term conditions, including increased demands due to climate change adaptation and other emerging stressors; and under conditions caused by single or multiple extreme hazard events (extreme weather, windstorms, earthquakes, tsunamis, storm surges, landslides, and fire, including wildland-urban interface fire). The ECI program also supports research on geomaterials and infrastructure materials utilized in load-bearing systems as well as in non-structural systems. Of particular interest is experimental and analytical/computational research to advance the fundamental understanding of coupled multi-physics, multi-scale (spatial and temporal), multi-functional behavior of these materials and their intended use in civil infrastructure.\n\r\n\nThe ECI program supports research on civil infrastructure that contributes to the National Science Foundation&rsquo;s role in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) and the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP). Principal Investigators are encouraged to leverage NSF&rsquo;s investments in the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) experimental, computational modeling and simulation, and data resources (<a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://www.designsafe-ci.org/\">https://www.designsafe-ci.org/</a>) in their research to accelerate advances needed for reducing the impacts of natural hazards on civil infrastructure. The NHERI Science Plan (<a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://www.designsafe-ci.org/facilities/nco/science-plan/\">https://www.designsafe-ci.org/facilities/nco/science-plan/</a>) offers a range of research topics that could benefit from the use of NHERI resources and are relevant to the ECI program.\n\r\n\nThe ECI program does not support research that addresses natural resource exploration or recovery, investigates blasts and explosions, develops sensor and measurement technologies, or focuses on hazard characterization.

Many programs in the Engineering Directorate support research in environmentally benign manufacturing or chemical processes. The Environmental Sustainability program supports research that would affect more than one chemical or manufacturing process or that takes a systems or holistic approach to green engineering for infrastructure or green buildings. Improvements in distribution and collection systems that will advance smart growth strategies and ameliorate effects of growth are research areas that are supported by Environmental Sustainability. Innovations in management of storm water, recycling and reuse of drinking water, and other green engineering techniques to support sustainability may also be fruitful areas for research.</li>\r\n<li>Ecological engineering:Proposals should focus on the engineering aspects of restoring ecological function to natural systems. Engineering research in the enhancement of natural capital to foster sustainable development is encouraged.</li>\r\n<li>Earth systems engineering:Earth systems engineering considers aspects of large-scale engineering research that involve mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation to climate change, and other global concerns.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\nAll proposed research should be driven by engineering principles, and be presented explicitly in an environmental sustainability context.

Research should focus on critical challenges and opportunities in both new and proven catalysis technologies. Areas of emphasis may include novel catalyst compositions, structures, operating environment, data science tools, theory, and modeling &ndash; preferably in various combinations as dictated by the specific reaction and related knowledge and technology gaps. Target applications include fuels, specialty and bulk chemicals, environmental catalysis, biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals, greenhouse gas mitigation, recycling of waste materials, generation of solar hydrogen, as well as efficient routes to energy utilization.\n\r\n\nHeterogeneous catalysis represents the main thrust of the program. Proposals related to both gas-solid and liquid-solid heterogeneous catalysis are welcome, as are proposals that incorporate concepts from homogeneous catalysis. Recent research trends have highlighted the need for evaluation of catalyst performance and properties under working conditions, especially as supported by advanced in situ and in operando characterization methods. Catalyst synthesizability and stability present additional research opportunities given the harsh operating environments of many catalytic processes. \n\r\n\nTopic areas of particular interest include:\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Energy-related catalysis, utilizing renewable or sustainable energy in lieu of thermal, fossil fuel-based technologies, especially applications in electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and catalytic conversion of biomass-derived chemicals, and also including fuel cell catalysis.</li>\r\n<li>Catalysis aimed at closing the carbon cycle (especially conversion of carbon dioxide, methane, and natural gas to fuels and chemical intermediates).</li>\r\n<li>Heterogeneous catalytic alternatives to traditionally non-catalytic or homogeneous reaction processes, as well as new catalyst designs for established catalytic processes.</li>\r\n<li>Environmental catalysis focused on mitigating both air and water pollutants, and supporting energy-efficient upcycling of waste materials to higher-value products.</li>\r\n<li>Catalytic remediation of feedstocks, process streams, products, or effluents.</li>\r\n<li>Commercially scalable methods of catalyst synthesis, including durable, poison-resistant, and easily regenerable catalyst formulations and designs.</li>\r\n<li>New catalytic materials and architectures (especially those substituting earth-abundant materials for precious and noble metal catalysts).</li>\r\n<li>Basic understanding of catalytic materials, reaction pathways, kinetics, and surface reaction mechanisms.</li>\r\n<li>Advanced tools for catalyst characterization and theoretical/computational catalysis.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\nProposals that deal with new catalytic materials, especially when viewed in light of the inherent complexity of heterogeneous catalytic reactions, will be enhanced by including plans to assess: 1) reproducibility and repeatability of data, 2) stability under realistic operating conditions including start-up and shut-down cycles, 3) performance relative to standard or well-known reference materials, and 4) quantitative, well-accepted measures of catalyst activity, selectivity, and catalytic efficiency, such as turnover frequencies, quantum and/or photon yields of photocatalysts, Faradaic efficiency of electrocatalytic reactions, and detailed product analyses and mass balances for the targeted application.\n\r\n\nNOTE: Proposals that focus on 1) molecular or homogeneous catalysis, 2) the surface science of catalysis, 3) photo redox catalysis, 4) catalytic organic synthesis reactions, and/or 5) fine chemical synthesis and pharmaceutical applications of catalysis may be more appropriately submitted to the Chemical Catalysis program.(CHE 6884) in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences. Proposals focused on biocatalytic processes, including proposals focusing on enzyme engineering, cellular and biomolecular processes, should be submitted to the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering program (CBET 1491). If the proposal focuses on reaction engineering aspects of catalytic processes, submit to the Process Systems, Reaction Engineering, and Molecular Thermodynamics program (CBET 1403). Projects that are interdisciplinary in nature may be jointly funded with other CBET and NSF programs. Program directors will review the submissions and may transfer your proposal to give it the best review situation.\n\r\n\nInnovative proposals outside of these specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.\n\r\n\nINFORMATION COMMON TO MOST CBET PROGRAMS\n\r\n\nProposals should address the novelty and/or<a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/about/transformative_research/faq.jsp\">potentially transformative nature</a>of the proposed work compared to previous work in the field.Also, it is important to address why the proposed work is important in terms of engineering science, as well as to also project the potential impact on society and/or industry of success in the research.The novelty or potentially transformative nature of the research should be included, as a minimum, in the Project Summary of each proposal.\n\r\n\nThe duration of unsolicited proposal awards in CBET is generally up to three years. Single-investigator award budgets typically include support for one graduate student (or equivalent) and up to one month of principal investigator time per year(awards for multiple investigator projects are typically larger). Proposal budgets that are much larger than typical should be discussed with the program director prior to submission. Proposers can view budget amounts and other information from recent awards made by this program via the ?What Has Been Funded (Recent Awards Made Through This Program, with Abstracts)? link towards the bottom of this page.\n\r\n\nFaculty Early Career Development(CAREER)program proposals are strongly encouraged. Award duration is five years.The submission deadline for Engineering CAREER proposals is in July every year. Learn more in the <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/career\">CAREER program description</a>.\n\r\n\nProposals for Conferences, Workshops, and Supplements: PIs are strongly encouraged to discuss their requests with the rogram director before submission of the proposal.\n\r\n\nGrants forRapid Response Research(RAPID)andEArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research(EAGER)are also considered when appropriate. Please note that proposals of these types must be discussed with the program director before submission. Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)proposals that integrate fundamental research with translational results and are consistent with the application areas of interest to each program are also encouraged.

2) the Interfacial Engineering program; and 3) the Process Systems, Reaction Engineering, and Molecular Thermodynamics program.\n\r\n\nThe goals of the Catalysis program are to increase fundamental understanding in catalytic engineering science and to advance the development of catalysts and catalytic reactions that are beneficial to society. Research should focus on critical challenges and opportunities in both new and proven catalysis technologies. Areas of emphasis may include novel catalyst compositions, structures, operating environment, data science tools, theory, and modeling &ndash; preferably in various combinations as dictated by the specific reaction and related knowledge and technology gaps. Target applications include fuels, specialty and bulk chemicals, environmental catalysis, biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals, greenhouse gas mitigation, recycling of waste materials, generation of solar hydrogen, as well as efficient routes to energy utilization.\n\r\n\nHeterogeneous catalysis represents the main thrust of the program. Proposals related to both gas-solid and liquid-solid heterogeneous catalysis are welcome, as are proposals that incorporate concepts from homogeneous catalysis. Recent research trends have highlighted the need for evaluation of catalyst performance and properties under working conditions, especially as supported by advanced in situ and in operando characterization methods. Catalyst synthesizability and stability present additional research opportunities given the harsh operating environments of many catalytic processes. \n\r\n\nTopic areas of particular interest include:\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Energy-related catalysis, utilizing renewable or sustainable energy in lieu of thermal, fossil fuel-based technologies, especially applications in electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and catalytic conversion of biomass-derived chemicals, and also including fuel cell catalysis.</li>\r\n<li>Catalysis aimed at closing the carbon cycle (especially conversion of carbon dioxide, methane, and natural gas to fuels and chemical intermediates).</li>\r\n<li>Heterogeneous catalytic alternatives to traditionally non-catalytic or homogeneous reaction processes, as well as new catalyst designs for established catalytic processes.</li>\r\n<li>Environmental catalysis focused on mitigating both air and water pollutants, and supporting energy-efficient upcycling of waste materials to higher-value products.</li>\r\n<li>Catalytic remediation of feedstocks, process streams, products, or effluents.</li>\r\n<li>Commercially scalable methods of catalyst synthesis, including durable, poison-resistant, and easily regenerable catalyst formulations and designs.</li>\r\n<li>New catalytic materials and architectures (especially those substituting earth-abundant materials for precious and noble metal catalysts).</li>\r\n<li>Basic understanding of catalytic materials, reaction pathways, kinetics, and surface reaction mechanisms.</li>\r\n<li>Advanced tools for catalyst characterization and theoretical/computational catalysis.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\nProposals that deal with new catalytic materials, especially when viewed in light of the inherent complexity of heterogeneous catalytic reactions, will be enhanced by including plans to assess: 1) reproducibility and repeatability of data, 2) stability under realistic operating conditions including start-up and shut-down cycles, 3) performance relative to standard or well-known reference materials, and 4) quantitative, well-accepted measures of catalyst activity, selectivity, and catalytic efficiency, such as turnover frequencies, quantum and/or photon yields of photocatalysts, Faradaic efficiency of electrocatalytic reactions, and detailed product analyses and mass balances for the targeted application.\n\r\n\nNOTE: Proposals that focus on 1) molecular or homogeneous catalysis, 2) the surface science of catalysis, 3) photo redox catalysis, 4) catalytic organic synthesis reactions, and/or 5) fine chemical synthesis and pharmaceutical applications of catalysis may be more appropriately submitted to the Chemical Catalysis program.(CHE 6884) in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences. Proposals focused on biocatalytic processes, including proposals focusing on enzyme engineering, cellular and biomolecular processes, should be submitted to the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering program (CBET 1491). If the proposal focuses on reaction engineering aspects of catalytic processes, submit to the Process Systems, Reaction Engineering, and Molecular Thermodynamics program (CBET 1403). Projects that are interdisciplinary in nature may be jointly funded with other CBET and NSF programs. Program directors will review the submissions and may transfer your proposal to give it the best review situation.\n\r\n\nInnovative proposals outside of these specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.\n\r\n\nINFORMATION COMMON TO MOST CBET PROGRAMS\n\r\n\nProposals should address the novelty and/or<a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/about/transformative_research/faq.jsp\">potentially transformative nature</a>of the proposed work compared to previous work in the field.Also, it is important to address why the proposed work is important in terms of engineering science, as well as to also project the potential impact on society and/or industry of success in the research.The novelty or potentially transformative nature of the research should be included, as a minimum, in the Project Summary of each proposal.\n\r\n\nThe duration of unsolicited proposal awards in CBET is generally up to three years. Single-investigator award budgets typically include support for one graduate student (or equivalent) and up to one month of principal investigator time per year(awards for multiple investigator projects are typically larger). Proposal budgets that are much larger than typical should be discussed with the program director prior to submission. Proposers can view budget amounts and other information from recent awards made by this program via the ?What Has Been Funded (Recent Awards Made Through This Program, with Abstracts)? link towards the bottom of this page.\n\r\n\nFaculty Early Career Development(CAREER)program proposals are strongly encouraged.

This NOFO also encourages the development of new solar hardware and technology for domestic use and potential export. These activities are expected to deliver jobs and economic growth in the clean energy sector, while increasing national energy security.\n\nTopic Area 1 seeks to conduct early-stage pilot-scale testing and demonstration of innovative processes or products that can substantively increase domestic manufacturing in all segments of the crystalline silicon solar module supply chain. Each segment also includes the manufacturing equipment used in that segment, input materials for that segment, process control and characterization tools, and consumables used in that segment, which today are predominantly made outside the United States.\n\nTopic Area 2 aims to support the cadmium telluride (CdTe) PV industry, an increasingly valuable part of the U.S. economy and leading domestic renewable energy technology. All segments of the CdTe PV module supply chain are of interest, including improvements in materials, processes, manufacturing, components, metrology, demonstration, recycling, and reclamation.\n\nTopic Area 3 is focused on R&D and demonstration activities with the goal of de-risking new non-module PV components and manufacturing processes, while developing and validating a realistic pathway to commercial success. This includes structural and electrical components and tools that can be made domestically and improve performance, functionality, reliability, or ease of installation for PV systems.", "agencyDetails": {"code": "GFO", "seed": "DOE-GFO", "agencyCode": "DOE-GFO", "agencyName": "Golden Field Office", "topAgencyCode": "DOE"}, "opportunityId": 358077, "applicantTypes": [{"id": "22", "description": "For profit organizations other than small businesses"}, {"id": "23", "description": "Small businesses"}], "archiveDateStr": "2025-06-29-00-00-00", "numberOfAwards": "10", "postingDateStr": "2025-01-08-00-00-00", "createTimeStamp": "Jan 08, 2025 11:33:37 AM EST", "lastUpdatedDate": "Jan 08, 2025 11:33:31 AM EST", "responseDateStr": "2025-05-30-00-00-00", "estimatedFunding": "20000000", "responseDateDesc": "", "topAgencyDetails": {"code": "DOE", "seed": "DOE", "agencyCode": "DOE", "agencyName": "Department of Energy", "topAgencyCode": "DOE"}, "agencyAddressDesc": "Click to email contact", "agencyContactDesc": "For questions regarding this NOFO: \nsolar.incubator@ee.doe.gov\n For questions regarding Exchange: \nEERE-eXCHANGESupport@hq.doe.gov", "agencyContactName": "Golden Field Office", "agencyContactEmail": "solar.incubator@ee.doe.gov", "agencyContactPhone": "202 287-1878", "createTimeStampStr": "2025-01-08-11-33-37", "fundingDescLinkUrl": "https://eere-exchange.energy.gov/Default.aspx#FoaIdfe9cde0d-e5d0-440a-805a-b83965617735", "fundingInstruments": [{"id": "CA", "description": "Cooperative Agreement"}], "awardFloorFormatted": "1,000,000", "fundingDescLinkDesc": "EERE Funding Opportunity Exchange", "awardCeilingFormatted": "4,000,000", "agencyContactEmailDesc": "Click to email contact", "applicantEligibilityDesc": "", "estimatedFundingFormatted": "20,000,000", "fundingActivityCategories": [{"id": "EN", "description": "Energy"}]}, "assistURL": "", "draftMode": "N", "relatedOpps": [], "publisherUid": "goadmin", "agencyDetails": {"code": "GFO", "seed": "DOE-GFO", "agencyCode": "DOE-GFO", "agencyName": "Golden Field Office", "topAgencyCode": "DOE"}, "errorMessages": [], "opportunityPkgs": [], "originalDueDate": "May 30, 2025 12:00:00 AM EDT", "assistCompatible": false, "opportunityTitle": "Fiscal Year 2025 Solar Module and Solar Hardware (SMASH) Incubator", "owningAgencyCode": "DOE-GFO", "topAgencyDetails": {"code": "DOE", "seed": "DOE", "agencyCode": "DOE", "agencyName": "Department of Energy", "topAgencyCode": "DOE"}, "forecastHistCount": 0, "opportunityNumber": "DE-FOA-0003460", "synPostDateInPast": true, "synopsisHistCount": 0, "opportunityCategory": {"category": "D", "description": "Discretionary"}, "originalDueDateDesc": "", "synAttChangeComments": [], "synopsisDocumentURLs": [], "closedOpportunityPkgs": [], "forecastModifiedFields": [], "synopsisModifiedFields": [], "opportunityHistoryDetails": [], "synopsisAttachmentFolders": [{"id": 76685, "folderName": "DE-FOA-0003460 (BASE)", "folderType": "Full Announcement", "zipLobSize": 1526579, "createdDate": "Jan 08, 2025 11:33:35 AM EST", "opportunityId": 358077, "lastUpdatedDate": "Jan 08, 2025 11:33:37 AM EST", "synopsisAttachments": [{"id": 345945, "fileName": "DE-FOA-0003460 Solar Module and Solar Hardware (SMASH) Incubator.pdf", "mimeType": "application/octet-stream", "createdDate": "Jan 08, 2025 11:33:36 AM EST", "fileLobSize": 1686922, "opportunityId": 358077, "fileDescription": "DE-FOA-0003460 Solar Module and Solar Hardware (SMASH) Incubator", "synopsisAttFolderId": 76685}]}]}', '{"source": {"id": "7767eedc-8a09-4058-8837-fc8df8e437cb", "url": "https://www.grants.gov/search-grants", "name": "Grants.gov", "type": "federal", "notes": "Two-stage API system: 1) Search API for opportunity listings 2) Detail API requires separate calls using opportunity IDs for full details", "active": true, "priority": 5, "auth_type": "none", "created_at": "2025-03-29T21:21:19.251067+00:00", "updated_at": "2025-04-09T05:56:11.645476+00:00", "api_endpoint": "https://api.grants.gov/v1/api/search2", "auth_details": {}, "handler_type": "standard", "last_checked": "2025-04-05T21:05:18.788+00:00", "organization": "General Services Administration (GSA)", "configurations": {"request_body": {"keyword": "energy;

More than one in five, 21.6 percent, had used any form of tobacco. Current use rates (i.e., rates of use within the past 30 days) were 1.2 percent for cigarettes, 5.9 percent for vapes, and 7.3 percent for any form of tobacco. More than a quarter of them, 27.2 percent, used two or more tobacco products.  Marijuana use among California youth is also a major concern. Like tobacco, marijuana is addictive and can interfere with brain development, leading to difficulties with paying attention, thinking, and problem-solving. It can cause problems with young people’s social lives and has been linked to mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, youth use rates in California are even higher for marijuana than for tobacco. In the 2023 CYTS, 23.0 percent of high school students had ever used marijuana, while 10.4 percent were current users and 4.9 percent co-used marijuana and tobacco. Considering twelfth graders only, 28.9 percent had ever used marijuana, 14.0 percent were current users, and 6.4 percent co-used marijuana and tobacco. Co-use is driven in part by vaping devices that can be used with either substance.   There are clear disparities in tobacco use by rurality in California. According to the 2023 CYTS, 1.1 percent of students in urban schools reported current cigarette use, 5.7 percent used vapes, and 6.9 percent used any form of tobacco, whereas in rural schools, 1.9 percent of students reported current cigarette use, 8.0 percent used vapes, and 9.6 percent used any form of tobacco. For every type of tobacco product, including smokeless tobacco, cigars, little cigars/cigarillos, hookah, heated tobacco products, and nicotine pouches, current use rates were higher for rural students than for urban students. Exacerbating these disparities, rural schools are less likely than urban schools to participate in the TUPE Program and if they do, are less likely to do so at a level that funds comprehensive student services.  The purpose of this RFA is to counter these trends by developing up to two Rural Initiative Centers to increase student access to tobacco-use prevention education services in underserved rural areas. The CDE is soliciting proposals to operate these new centers from county offices of education that can demonstrate extensive experience operating high-performing rural TUPE programs. Having defined the region(s) to be served by their centers and demonstrated their capacity to increase rural student access to TUPE services, successful applicants will work with the CDE to develop, implement, promote, and evaluate new program offerings. These new offerings will include: (1) subawards for local champions willing to undertake TUPE work in rural school districts that currently receive no TUPE funding, and (2) opportunities for mentorship and information exchange for TUPE leads at all levels in the region(s) served by the centers.

An additional six months (January 1, 2029 to June 30, 2029) will be included in the term of the grant agreement for the sole purposes of finalizing and submitting a required Local Evaluation Report and a required audit.  Applicants eligible to apply for the CalVIP Cohort 5 funding fall into four categories:1. Cities that are “disproportionately impacted by violence” (listed in Table 1 below).2. Counties that have one or more cities disproportionately impacted by violence within their jurisdiction (listed in Table 2 below).3. Tribal governments located within the identified counties (listed in Table 3 below).4. Community-based organizations that serve the residents of the cities and/or tribal governments identified in Tables 1 and 3.  The total available funding through this CalVIP Request for Proposals is $103 million. This amount includes the first two anticipated annual allocations to the BSCC from the Gun Violence Prevention and School Safety Fund.  Applicants may apply for any amount up to and including the maximum grant amount for each Applicant Category, as shown in Table 4, of the RFP. Applicants are strongly encouraged to apply for only the amount of funding needed to implement the project. Proposals will be scored, in part, on the reasonableness of the applicant’s proposed budget.  BSCC is required to make 20 percent (20%) of a grantee’s total award available at the start of the grant period. Please refer to page 29 for more information on the advance payment and invoicing processes.  There is no match requirement for the CalVIP Cohort 5 Grant.  Authorizing statute mandates that projects funded by the CalVIP grant funds “shall be primarily focused on providing violence intervention services to the small segment of the population that is identified as high risk of perpetrating or being victimized by community gun violence in the near future.” (Pen. Code, § 14131, subd. (c).)  Authorizing statute mandates that CalVIP grants “shall be used to develop, support, expand, and replicate evidence-based community gun violence reduction initiatives, including, without limitation, hospital-based violence intervention programs, evidence-based street outreach programs, and focused deterrence strategies, that seek to interrupt cycles of community gun violence and retaliation in order to reduce the incidence of homicides, shootings, and aggravated assaults.” (Pen.

This timeline should include a detailed process for assessment, capacity building, bolstered support, and compliance checks, as well as a plan for establishing participation by and benefits for all 58 counties. State-Local Partner Capacity Building Increase technical assistance and training to SLPs that meets the unique needs of each organization, as identified by research and evaluation. Ensure that SLP contracts are written to require adherence to key CAC policies and expectations, clearly outlining the role of the state-county partnership. Develop strategies to align SLP priorities with the priorities of the CAC, while allowing for flexibility and self-determination. Support the development and implementation of local plans that result in consistent quality and equity of service across counties. In 2023, the Council voted to increase the annual maximum request amount for the SLP grant to $75,000, in recognition of the outcomes of the SLP Equity Impact Assessment and the need for increased ongoing funding to support SLP work. State-Local Partners serve as Poetry Out Loud partners and will receive financial support of $5,000 through this grant program (also included in the maximum request amount) to facilitate an annual Poetry Out Loud program throughout their county, either through direct programming or in partnership with another local organization/agency.

A local arts agency can be an agency of local government, a nonprofit organization, or a hybrid of the two.  The CAC’s Strategic Framework, adopted in 2019, indicates aspirational areas that will be directly addressed by this grant program:  State-Local Partner Capacity Building Increase technical assistance and training to SLPs that meets the unique needs of each organization, as identified by research and evaluation. Ensure that SLP contracts are written to require adherence to key CAC policies and expectations, clearly outlining the role of the state-county partnership. Develop strategies to align SLP priorities with the priorities of the CAC, while allowing for flexibility and self-determination. Support the development and implementation of local plans that result in consistent quality and equity of services across counties.  Geographic Equity Explore how to best address grantmaking equity for the disparate regions of the state. Utilize data analysis to assess present-day regional disparities among CAC grantees. Seek guidance from existing funding models that address how to identify and give preference to disadvantaged communities. The CAC expects that an active SLP will be established in the identified county within 2-3 years, either as a unit of County government or an independent 501(c)(3), and that the SLP-M will mentor them through their first two years of arts programming and services, after which the mentee organization could qualify for an SLP grant independently.

CDFW strives to conduct investigations as soon as reasonably possible to preserve physical evidence and gather information from producers and potential eyewitnesses.  Wolf depredation is “confirmed” when there is physical evidence that an animal was injured or killed by a wolf and “probable” when there is sufficient evidence to suggest wolf predation (e.g., evidence of predation and evidence that wolves were likely present at the time of injury or death), but not enough evidence to confirm it.   Upon issuance of compensation for a direct loss, producers will be expected to consult with the Department to evaluate and implement a deterrent strategy that may be beneficial in reducing wolf-livestock conflict.

The California Natural Resources Agency (Agency) prescribes procedures and criteria to evaluate grant project proposals and submits a list of projects recommended for funding to the California Transportation Commission (CTC). The CTC awards grants to projects from Agency’s list.  Related Transportation Facility  EEM projects must mitigate, either directly or indirectly, the environmental impacts of a) the modification of an existing Transportation Facility or b) the construction of a new Transportation Facility (hereafter Related Transportation Facility or RTF). The EEM project can be the required mitigation for the RTF or enhancement to mitigation required for the RTF.  Statewide Project Goals  Agency grant programs assist state and local entities to develop more sustainable communities, increase adaptability to climate change using nature-based strategies, and protect biodiversity in compliance with Executive Order N-82-20, the Pathways to 30 x 30 California, and the Natural and Working Lands Climate Smart Strategy. Projects that demonstrate the following multiple benefits will be more competitive:  • Improved air and/or water quality.  • Reduced consumption of natural resources and energy.  • Increased reliability of local water supplies.  • Increased adaptability to climate change.  • Increased protection and restoration of biodiversity  Eligible Projects Examples  The list below isn''t comprehensive, but provides examples of project elements that meet statutory conditions.  Urban Forestry:  • Planting of trees and plants along urban streets and medians.  • Greening existing public lands and structures, including school campuses and urban parks.  • Greening vacant lots and abandoned sites.  • Restoration of urban creeks.  Resource Lands:  • Removal of invasive and restoration of natural plant species.  • Enhancement or restoration of natural areas such as inland wetlands, forests, oak woodlands, mountain meadows, creeks, and streams with riparian or riverine fish or wildlife habitat, wildlife corridors and fish passages, coastal estuaries, grazing land and grasslands.  • Acquisitions in fee title or through conservation easements to safeguard regional water supplies, protect riparian and wildlife habitats, conserve agricultural lands for secure wildlife migration corridors, and provide public access for compatible wildlife/nature-oriented recreation by the wider community.  • Acquisitions to preserve in perpetuity Resource Lands for agricultural uses, open space, wetlands, biodiversity, etc.  Mitigation Projects Beyond the Scope of the Lead Agency:  Project examples listed under Urban Forestry and Resource Lands categories may be eligible for the Mitigation Projects Beyond the Scope of the Lead Agency category, if the mitigation or enhancement measures for the RTF were infeasible or beyond the jurisdiction and/or authority of the Lead Agency for the RTF.  Project Criteria Questions  Applicants must choose only one project category and respond to all questions in the selected category.

Processes utilizing electrochemistry or photochemistry for sustainable energy and chemical production must be scalable, environmentally benign, reduce greenhouse gas production, and utilize renewable resources. Research projects that stress fundamental understanding of phenomena that directly impact key barriers to improved system or component-level performance (for example, energy efficiency, product yield, process intensification) are encouraged. Processes for energy storage should address fundamental research barriers for renewable electricity storage applications, for transport propulsion, or for other applications that could have impact towards climate change mitigation. For projects concerning energy storage materials, proposals should involve testable hypotheses that involve device or component performance characteristics that are tied to fundamental understanding of transport, kinetics, or thermodynamics. Advanced chemistries beyond lithium-ion are encouraged. Proposed research on processes utilizing electrochemistry or photochemistry should be inspired by the need for economic and impactful conversion processes.\n\r\n\nAll proposal project descriptions should address how the proposed work, if successful, will improve process realization and economic feasibility and compare the proposed work against current state of the art. Highly integrated multidisciplinary projects are encouraged. When appropriate, collaborations with industrial technologists are encouraged through GOALI proposals. Collaborative projects with an integrated experimental and theoretical approach are also encouraged.\n\r\n\nTopics of interest include electrochemical energy storage and electrochemical production/conversion systems. Radically new battery systems can move the U.S. more rapidly toward a more sustainable transportation future and to greater renewable electricity production penetration. High-energy density and high-power density batteries suitable for transportation and renewable energy storage applications are of primary interest. Advanced systems involving metal anodes, solid-state electrolytes, nonaqueous systemsbeyond lithium, aqueous systems beyond lithium,and multivalent chemistries are encouraged.

Many programs in the Engineering Directorate support research in environmentally benign manufacturing or chemical processes. The Environmental Sustainability program supports research that would affect more than one chemical or manufacturing process or that takes a systems or holistic approach to green engineering for infrastructure or green buildings. Improvements in distribution and collection systems that will advance smart growth strategies and ameliorate effects of growth are research areas that are supported by Environmental Sustainability. Innovations in management of storm water, recycling and reuse of drinking water, and other green engineering techniques to support sustainability may also be fruitful areas for research.</li>\r\n<li>Ecological engineering:Proposals should focus on the engineering aspects of restoring ecological function to natural systems.

However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review. For proposals that call for research to be done on regions that are outside of the United States, an explanation must be presented of the potential benefit of the research for the United States.\n\r\n\nINFORMATION COMMON TO MOST CBET PROGRAMS\n\r\n\nProposals should address the novelty and/or<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/about/transformative_research/faq.jsp\">potentially transformative nature</a></span>of the proposed work compared to previous work in the field.

The novelty or potentially transformative nature of the research should be included, as a minimum, in the Project Summary of each proposal.\n\r\n\nThe duration of unsolicited proposal awards in CBET is generally up to three years. Single-investigator award budgets typically include support for one graduate student (or equivalent) and up to one month of PI time per year(awards for multiple investigator projects are typically larger). Proposal budgets that are much larger than typical should be discussed with the program director prior to submission. Proposers can view budget amounts and other information from recent awards made by this program via the &ldquo;What Has Been Funded (Recent Awards Made Through This Program, with Abstracts)&rdquo; link towards the bottom of this page.\n\r\n\nFaculty Early Career Development(CAREER)program proposals are strongly encouraged. Award duration is five years. The submission deadline for Engineering CAREER proposals is in July every year. Learn more in the<a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/career\">CAREER program description</a>.\n\r\n\nProposals for Conferences, Workshops, and Supplements: PIs are strongly encouraged to discuss their requests with the program director before submission of the proposal.\n\r\n\nGrants forRapid Response Research(RAPID)andEArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research(EAGER)are also considered when appropriate.Please note that proposals of these types must be discussed with the program director before submission.Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)proposals that integrate fundamental research with translational results and are consistent with the application areas of interest to each program are also encouraged. Please note that RAPID, EAGER, and GOALI proposals can be submitted anytime during the year.

Processes utilizing electrochemistry or photochemistry for sustainable energy and chemical production must be scalable, environmentally benign, reduce greenhouse gas production, and utilize renewable resources. Research projects that stress fundamental understanding of phenomena that directly impact key barriers to improved system or component-level performance (for example, energy efficiency, product yield, process intensification) are encouraged. Processes for energy storage should address fundamental research barriers for renewable electricity storage applications, for transport propulsion, or for other applications that could have impact towards climate change mitigation. For projects concerning energy storage materials, proposals should involve testable hypotheses that involve device or component performance characteristics that are tied to fundamental understanding of transport, kinetics, or thermodynamics. Advanced chemistries beyond lithium-ion are encouraged. Proposed research on processes utilizing electrochemistry or photochemistry should be inspired by the need for economic and impactful conversion processes.\n\r\n\nAll proposal project descriptions should address how the proposed work, if successful, will improve process realization and economic feasibility and compare the proposed work against current state of the art. Highly integrated multidisciplinary projects are encouraged. When appropriate, collaborations with industrial technologists are encouraged through GOALI proposals. Collaborative projects with an integrated experimental and theoretical approach are also encouraged.\n\r\n\nTopics of interest include electrochemical energy storage and electrochemical production/conversion systems. Radically new battery systems can move the U.S. more rapidly toward a more sustainable transportation future and to greater renewable electricity production penetration. High-energy density and high-power density batteries suitable for transportation and renewable energy storage applications are of primary interest. Advanced systems involving metal anodes, solid-state electrolytes, nonaqueous systemsbeyond lithium, aqueous systems beyond lithium,and multivalent chemistries are encouraged. Research activities focused on commercially available systems such as lead-acid and nickel-metal hydride batteries or lithium-ion batteries for medical or consumer electronics applications will not be considered by this program. Novel electrochemical and photochemical systems and processes for the production of chemicals and high-value products are encouraged. Emphasis is placed on those systems that improve process intensification and process modularization with accompanying benefits in energy efficiency and environmental footprint.\n\r\n\nAdditional fundamental science topics of interest to this program include the study of:\n\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>advanced fuel cell systems or fuel cell components for transportation propulsion or grid energy storage applications;</li>\r\n<li>flow batteries for stationary energy storage applications including alternative redox chemistries (e.g., organic, inorganic, organometallic, macromolecular) and operating strategies (e.g., redox-mediation, suspensions); and</li>\r\n<li>photocatalytic or photoelectrochemical processes and devices for the splitting of water into hydrogen gas or for the reduction of carbon dioxide to liquid or gaseous fuels. Projects that largely focus on developing fundamental understanding of the catalytic reaction mechanisms and structure-function relationships may be more appropriate as submissions to the CBET Catalysis program (CBET 1401).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\nProjects submitted to the Electrochemical Systems program are expected to develop fundamental, molecular-level understanding of the key chemical reaction and transport phenomena barriers to improved system-level performance. Innovative proposals outside of these specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.\n\r\n\nReferrals to other programs within NSF:\n\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Proposals that focus on electric-field driven separations such as dielectrophoresis should be directed to theInterfacial Engineeringprogram (CBET 1417).</li>\r\n<li>Proposals that focus on thermal management of energy storage devices and systems should be submitted to theThermal Transport Processesprogram (CBET 1406).</li>\r\n<li>Proposals that focus on improving device and system performance of primarily organic, inorganic, and hybrid photovoltaic (PV) technologies, including perovskites, may be more appropriate as submissions to the Electronics, Photonics, and Magnetic Devices program in Engineering''s Division of Electrical, Communications, and Cyber Systems (ECCS 1517). PV materials proposals that focus on the material science may be considered in the Division of Materials Research of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.</li>\r\n<li>Proposals that focus on the generation of thermal energy by solar radiation should be directed to theThermal Transport Processesprogram (CBET 1406).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\nINFORMATION COMMON TO MOST CBET PROGRAMS\n\r\n\nProposals should address the novelty and/or<a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/about/transformative_research/faq.jsp\">potentially transformative nature</a>of the proposed work compared to previous work in the field. Also, it is important to address why the proposed work is important in terms of engineering science, as well as to also project the potential impact on society and/or industry of success in the research. The novelty or potentially transformative nature of the research should be included, as a minimum, in the Project Summary of each proposal.\n\r\n\nThe duration of unsolicited proposal awards in CBET is generally up to three years. Single-investigator award budgets typically include support for one graduate student (or equivalent) and up to one month of principal investigator time per year(awards for multiple investigator projects are typically larger). Proposal budgets that are much larger than typical should be discussed with the Program Director prior to submission.

Processes utilizing electrochemistry or photochemistry for sustainable energy and chemical production must be scalable, environmentally benign, reduce greenhouse gas production, and utilize renewable resources. Research projects that stress fundamental understanding of phenomena that directly impact key barriers to improved system or component-level performance (for example, energy efficiency, product yield, process intensification) are encouraged. Processes for energy storage should address fundamental research barriers for renewable electricity storage applications, for transport propulsion, or for other applications that could have impact towards climate change mitigation. For projects concerning energy storage materials, proposals should involve testable hypotheses that involve device or component performance characteristics that are tied to fundamental understanding of transport, kinetics, or thermodynamics. Advanced chemistries beyond lithium-ion are encouraged. Proposed research on processes utilizing electrochemistry or photochemistry should be inspired by the need for economic and impactful conversion processes.\n\r\n\nAll proposal project descriptions should address how the proposed work, if successful, will improve process realization and economic feasibility and compare the proposed work against current state of the art.

The ECI program promotes research that can shape the future of the nation&rsquo;s physical civil infrastructure and that can contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation, and hazards and disaster resilience. Types of civil infrastructure that the ECI program considers include, but are not limited to, buildings, residential construction, earth and earth retaining structures, and components of flood protection systems; water, waste disposal, and wastewater systems; energy infrastructure (excluding nuclear); and transportation systems (excluding pavements). Both disciplinary and convergent research that can address the challenges of physical civil infrastructure to be resilient and sustainable over its service lifetime are of particular interest. Broader impacts of ECI research include fostering community welfare for an equitable and prosperous nation and promoting environmentally friendly, circular economy policies.\n\r\n\nThe ECI program supports research that advances knowledge on the behavior of physical civil infrastructure subjected to and interacting with the natural environment during construction; under service and long-term conditions, including increased demands due to climate change adaptation and other emerging stressors; and under conditions caused by single or multiple extreme hazard events (extreme weather, windstorms, earthquakes, tsunamis, storm surges, landslides, and fire, including wildland-urban interface fire). The ECI program also supports research on geomaterials and infrastructure materials utilized in load-bearing systems as well as in non-structural systems. Of particular interest is experimental and analytical/computational research to advance the fundamental understanding of coupled multi-physics, multi-scale (spatial and temporal), multi-functional behavior of these materials and their intended use in civil infrastructure.\n\r\n\nThe ECI program supports research on civil infrastructure that contributes to the National Science Foundation&rsquo;s role in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) and the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP). Principal Investigators are encouraged to leverage NSF&rsquo;s investments in the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) experimental, computational modeling and simulation, and data resources (<a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://www.designsafe-ci.org/\">https://www.designsafe-ci.org/</a>) in their research to accelerate advances needed for reducing the impacts of natural hazards on civil infrastructure. The NHERI Science Plan (<a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://www.designsafe-ci.org/facilities/nco/science-plan/\">https://www.designsafe-ci.org/facilities/nco/science-plan/</a>) offers a range of research topics that could benefit from the use of NHERI resources and are relevant to the ECI program.\n\r\n\nThe ECI program does not support research that addresses natural resource exploration or recovery, investigates blasts and explosions, develops sensor and measurement technologies, or focuses on hazard characterization.

Many programs in the Engineering Directorate support research in environmentally benign manufacturing or chemical processes. The Environmental Sustainability program supports research that would affect more than one chemical or manufacturing process or that takes a systems or holistic approach to green engineering for infrastructure or green buildings. Improvements in distribution and collection systems that will advance smart growth strategies and ameliorate effects of growth are research areas that are supported by Environmental Sustainability. Innovations in management of storm water, recycling and reuse of drinking water, and other green engineering techniques to support sustainability may also be fruitful areas for research.</li>\r\n<li>Ecological engineering:Proposals should focus on the engineering aspects of restoring ecological function to natural systems. Engineering research in the enhancement of natural capital to foster sustainable development is encouraged.</li>\r\n<li>Earth systems engineering:Earth systems engineering considers aspects of large-scale engineering research that involve mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation to climate change, and other global concerns.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\nAll proposed research should be driven by engineering principles, and be presented explicitly in an environmental sustainability context.

Research should focus on critical challenges and opportunities in both new and proven catalysis technologies. Areas of emphasis may include novel catalyst compositions, structures, operating environment, data science tools, theory, and modeling &ndash; preferably in various combinations as dictated by the specific reaction and related knowledge and technology gaps. Target applications include fuels, specialty and bulk chemicals, environmental catalysis, biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals, greenhouse gas mitigation, recycling of waste materials, generation of solar hydrogen, as well as efficient routes to energy utilization.\n\r\n\nHeterogeneous catalysis represents the main thrust of the program. Proposals related to both gas-solid and liquid-solid heterogeneous catalysis are welcome, as are proposals that incorporate concepts from homogeneous catalysis. Recent research trends have highlighted the need for evaluation of catalyst performance and properties under working conditions, especially as supported by advanced in situ and in operando characterization methods. Catalyst synthesizability and stability present additional research opportunities given the harsh operating environments of many catalytic processes. \n\r\n\nTopic areas of particular interest include:\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Energy-related catalysis, utilizing renewable or sustainable energy in lieu of thermal, fossil fuel-based technologies, especially applications in electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and catalytic conversion of biomass-derived chemicals, and also including fuel cell catalysis.</li>\r\n<li>Catalysis aimed at closing the carbon cycle (especially conversion of carbon dioxide, methane, and natural gas to fuels and chemical intermediates).</li>\r\n<li>Heterogeneous catalytic alternatives to traditionally non-catalytic or homogeneous reaction processes, as well as new catalyst designs for established catalytic processes.</li>\r\n<li>Environmental catalysis focused on mitigating both air and water pollutants, and supporting energy-efficient upcycling of waste materials to higher-value products.</li>\r\n<li>Catalytic remediation of feedstocks, process streams, products, or effluents.</li>\r\n<li>Commercially scalable methods of catalyst synthesis, including durable, poison-resistant, and easily regenerable catalyst formulations and designs.</li>\r\n<li>New catalytic materials and architectures (especially those substituting earth-abundant materials for precious and noble metal catalysts).</li>\r\n<li>Basic understanding of catalytic materials, reaction pathways, kinetics, and surface reaction mechanisms.</li>\r\n<li>Advanced tools for catalyst characterization and theoretical/computational catalysis.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\nProposals that deal with new catalytic materials, especially when viewed in light of the inherent complexity of heterogeneous catalytic reactions, will be enhanced by including plans to assess: 1) reproducibility and repeatability of data, 2) stability under realistic operating conditions including start-up and shut-down cycles, 3) performance relative to standard or well-known reference materials, and 4) quantitative, well-accepted measures of catalyst activity, selectivity, and catalytic efficiency, such as turnover frequencies, quantum and/or photon yields of photocatalysts, Faradaic efficiency of electrocatalytic reactions, and detailed product analyses and mass balances for the targeted application.\n\r\n\nNOTE: Proposals that focus on 1) molecular or homogeneous catalysis, 2) the surface science of catalysis, 3) photo redox catalysis, 4) catalytic organic synthesis reactions, and/or 5) fine chemical synthesis and pharmaceutical applications of catalysis may be more appropriately submitted to the Chemical Catalysis program.(CHE 6884) in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences. Proposals focused on biocatalytic processes, including proposals focusing on enzyme engineering, cellular and biomolecular processes, should be submitted to the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering program (CBET 1491). If the proposal focuses on reaction engineering aspects of catalytic processes, submit to the Process Systems, Reaction Engineering, and Molecular Thermodynamics program (CBET 1403). Projects that are interdisciplinary in nature may be jointly funded with other CBET and NSF programs. Program directors will review the submissions and may transfer your proposal to give it the best review situation.\n\r\n\nInnovative proposals outside of these specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.\n\r\n\nINFORMATION COMMON TO MOST CBET PROGRAMS\n\r\n\nProposals should address the novelty and/or<a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/about/transformative_research/faq.jsp\">potentially transformative nature</a>of the proposed work compared to previous work in the field.Also, it is important to address why the proposed work is important in terms of engineering science, as well as to also project the potential impact on society and/or industry of success in the research.The novelty or potentially transformative nature of the research should be included, as a minimum, in the Project Summary of each proposal.\n\r\n\nThe duration of unsolicited proposal awards in CBET is generally up to three years. Single-investigator award budgets typically include support for one graduate student (or equivalent) and up to one month of principal investigator time per year(awards for multiple investigator projects are typically larger). Proposal budgets that are much larger than typical should be discussed with the program director prior to submission. Proposers can view budget amounts and other information from recent awards made by this program via the ?What Has Been Funded (Recent Awards Made Through This Program, with Abstracts)? link towards the bottom of this page.\n\r\n\nFaculty Early Career Development(CAREER)program proposals are strongly encouraged. Award duration is five years.The submission deadline for Engineering CAREER proposals is in July every year. Learn more in the <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/career\">CAREER program description</a>.\n\r\n\nProposals for Conferences, Workshops, and Supplements: PIs are strongly encouraged to discuss their requests with the rogram director before submission of the proposal.\n\r\n\nGrants forRapid Response Research(RAPID)andEArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research(EAGER)are also considered when appropriate. Please note that proposals of these types must be discussed with the program director before submission. Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)proposals that integrate fundamental research with translational results and are consistent with the application areas of interest to each program are also encouraged.

2) the Interfacial Engineering program; and 3) the Process Systems, Reaction Engineering, and Molecular Thermodynamics program.\n\r\n\nThe goals of the Catalysis program are to increase fundamental understanding in catalytic engineering science and to advance the development of catalysts and catalytic reactions that are beneficial to society. Research should focus on critical challenges and opportunities in both new and proven catalysis technologies. Areas of emphasis may include novel catalyst compositions, structures, operating environment, data science tools, theory, and modeling &ndash; preferably in various combinations as dictated by the specific reaction and related knowledge and technology gaps. Target applications include fuels, specialty and bulk chemicals, environmental catalysis, biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals, greenhouse gas mitigation, recycling of waste materials, generation of solar hydrogen, as well as efficient routes to energy utilization.\n\r\n\nHeterogeneous catalysis represents the main thrust of the program. Proposals related to both gas-solid and liquid-solid heterogeneous catalysis are welcome, as are proposals that incorporate concepts from homogeneous catalysis. Recent research trends have highlighted the need for evaluation of catalyst performance and properties under working conditions, especially as supported by advanced in situ and in operando characterization methods. Catalyst synthesizability and stability present additional research opportunities given the harsh operating environments of many catalytic processes. \n\r\n\nTopic areas of particular interest include:\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Energy-related catalysis, utilizing renewable or sustainable energy in lieu of thermal, fossil fuel-based technologies, especially applications in electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and catalytic conversion of biomass-derived chemicals, and also including fuel cell catalysis.</li>\r\n<li>Catalysis aimed at closing the carbon cycle (especially conversion of carbon dioxide, methane, and natural gas to fuels and chemical intermediates).</li>\r\n<li>Heterogeneous catalytic alternatives to traditionally non-catalytic or homogeneous reaction processes, as well as new catalyst designs for established catalytic processes.</li>\r\n<li>Environmental catalysis focused on mitigating both air and water pollutants, and supporting energy-efficient upcycling of waste materials to higher-value products.</li>\r\n<li>Catalytic remediation of feedstocks, process streams, products, or effluents.</li>\r\n<li>Commercially scalable methods of catalyst synthesis, including durable, poison-resistant, and easily regenerable catalyst formulations and designs.</li>\r\n<li>New catalytic materials and architectures (especially those substituting earth-abundant materials for precious and noble metal catalysts).</li>\r\n<li>Basic understanding of catalytic materials, reaction pathways, kinetics, and surface reaction mechanisms.</li>\r\n<li>Advanced tools for catalyst characterization and theoretical/computational catalysis.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\nProposals that deal with new catalytic materials, especially when viewed in light of the inherent complexity of heterogeneous catalytic reactions, will be enhanced by including plans to assess: 1) reproducibility and repeatability of data, 2) stability under realistic operating conditions including start-up and shut-down cycles, 3) performance relative to standard or well-known reference materials, and 4) quantitative, well-accepted measures of catalyst activity, selectivity, and catalytic efficiency, such as turnover frequencies, quantum and/or photon yields of photocatalysts, Faradaic efficiency of electrocatalytic reactions, and detailed product analyses and mass balances for the targeted application.\n\r\n\nNOTE: Proposals that focus on 1) molecular or homogeneous catalysis, 2) the surface science of catalysis, 3) photo redox catalysis, 4) catalytic organic synthesis reactions, and/or 5) fine chemical synthesis and pharmaceutical applications of catalysis may be more appropriately submitted to the Chemical Catalysis program.(CHE 6884) in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences. Proposals focused on biocatalytic processes, including proposals focusing on enzyme engineering, cellular and biomolecular processes, should be submitted to the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering program (CBET 1491). If the proposal focuses on reaction engineering aspects of catalytic processes, submit to the Process Systems, Reaction Engineering, and Molecular Thermodynamics program (CBET 1403). Projects that are interdisciplinary in nature may be jointly funded with other CBET and NSF programs. Program directors will review the submissions and may transfer your proposal to give it the best review situation.\n\r\n\nInnovative proposals outside of these specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.\n\r\n\nINFORMATION COMMON TO MOST CBET PROGRAMS\n\r\n\nProposals should address the novelty and/or<a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/about/transformative_research/faq.jsp\">potentially transformative nature</a>of the proposed work compared to previous work in the field.Also, it is important to address why the proposed work is important in terms of engineering science, as well as to also project the potential impact on society and/or industry of success in the research.The novelty or potentially transformative nature of the research should be included, as a minimum, in the Project Summary of each proposal.\n\r\n\nThe duration of unsolicited proposal awards in CBET is generally up to three years. Single-investigator award budgets typically include support for one graduate student (or equivalent) and up to one month of principal investigator time per year(awards for multiple investigator projects are typically larger). Proposal budgets that are much larger than typical should be discussed with the program director prior to submission. Proposers can view budget amounts and other information from recent awards made by this program via the ?What Has Been Funded (Recent Awards Made Through This Program, with Abstracts)? link towards the bottom of this page.\n\r\n\nFaculty Early Career Development(CAREER)program proposals are strongly encouraged.

The California Natural Resources Agency (Agency) prescribes procedures and criteria to evaluate grant project proposals and submits a list of projects recommended for funding to the California Transportation Commission (CTC). The CTC awards grants to projects from Agency’s list.  Related Transportation Facility  EEM projects must mitigate, either directly or indirectly, the environmental impacts of a) the modification of an existing Transportation Facility or b) the construction of a new Transportation Facility (hereafter Related Transportation Facility or RTF). The EEM project can be the required mitigation for the RTF or enhancement to mitigation required for the RTF.  Statewide Project Goals  Agency grant programs assist state and local entities to develop more sustainable communities, increase adaptability to climate change using nature-based strategies, and protect biodiversity in compliance with Executive Order N-82-20, the Pathways to 30 x 30 California, and the Natural and Working Lands Climate Smart Strategy. Projects that demonstrate the following multiple benefits will be more competitive:  • Improved air and/or water quality.  • Reduced consumption of natural resources and energy.  • Increased reliability of local water supplies.  • Increased adaptability to climate change.  • Increased protection and restoration of biodiversity  Eligible Projects Examples  The list below isn''t comprehensive, but provides examples of project elements that meet statutory conditions.  Urban Forestry:  • Planting of trees and plants along urban streets and medians.  • Greening existing public lands and structures, including school campuses and urban parks.  • Greening vacant lots and abandoned sites.  • Restoration of urban creeks.  Resource Lands:  • Removal of invasive and restoration of natural plant species.  • Enhancement or restoration of natural areas such as inland wetlands, forests, oak woodlands, mountain meadows, creeks, and streams with riparian or riverine fish or wildlife habitat, wildlife corridors and fish passages, coastal estuaries, grazing land and grasslands.  • Acquisitions in fee title or through conservation easements to safeguard regional water supplies, protect riparian and wildlife habitats, conserve agricultural lands for secure wildlife migration corridors, and provide public access for compatible wildlife/nature-oriented recreation by the wider community.  • Acquisitions to preserve in perpetuity Resource Lands for agricultural uses, open space, wetlands, biodiversity, etc.  Mitigation Projects Beyond the Scope of the Lead Agency:  Project examples listed under Urban Forestry and Resource Lands categories may be eligible for the Mitigation Projects Beyond the Scope of the Lead Agency category, if the mitigation or enhancement measures for the RTF were infeasible or beyond the jurisdiction and/or authority of the Lead Agency for the RTF.

Processes utilizing electrochemistry or photochemistry for sustainable energy and chemical production must be scalable, environmentally benign, reduce greenhouse gas production, and utilize renewable resources. Research projects that stress fundamental understanding of phenomena that directly impact key barriers to improved system or component-level performance (for example, energy efficiency, product yield, process intensification) are encouraged. Processes for energy storage should address fundamental research barriers for renewable electricity storage applications, for transport propulsion, or for other applications that could have impact towards climate change mitigation. For projects concerning energy storage materials, proposals should involve testable hypotheses that involve device or component performance characteristics that are tied to fundamental understanding of transport, kinetics, or thermodynamics. Advanced chemistries beyond lithium-ion are encouraged. Proposed research on processes utilizing electrochemistry or photochemistry should be inspired by the need for economic and impactful conversion processes.\n\r\n\nAll proposal project descriptions should address how the proposed work, if successful, will improve process realization and economic feasibility and compare the proposed work against current state of the art. Highly integrated multidisciplinary projects are encouraged. When appropriate, collaborations with industrial technologists are encouraged through GOALI proposals. Collaborative projects with an integrated experimental and theoretical approach are also encouraged.\n\r\n\nTopics of interest include electrochemical energy storage and electrochemical production/conversion systems. Radically new battery systems can move the U.S. more rapidly toward a more sustainable transportation future and to greater renewable electricity production penetration. High-energy density and high-power density batteries suitable for transportation and renewable energy storage applications are of primary interest. Advanced systems involving metal anodes, solid-state electrolytes, nonaqueous systemsbeyond lithium, aqueous systems beyond lithium,and multivalent chemistries are encouraged. Research activities focused on commercially available systems such as lead-acid and nickel-metal hydride batteries or lithium-ion batteries for medical or consumer electronics applications will not be considered by this program. Novel electrochemical and photochemical systems and processes for the production of chemicals and high-value products are encouraged. Emphasis is placed on those systems that improve process intensification and process modularization with accompanying benefits in energy efficiency and environmental footprint.\n\r\n\nAdditional fundamental science topics of interest to this program include the study of:\n\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>advanced fuel cell systems or fuel cell components for transportation propulsion or grid energy storage applications;</li>\r\n<li>flow batteries for stationary energy storage applications including alternative redox chemistries (e.g., organic, inorganic, organometallic, macromolecular) and operating strategies (e.g., redox-mediation, suspensions); and</li>\r\n<li>photocatalytic or photoelectrochemical processes and devices for the splitting of water into hydrogen gas or for the reduction of carbon dioxide to liquid or gaseous fuels.

The ECI program promotes research that can shape the future of the nation&rsquo;s physical civil infrastructure and that can contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation, and hazards and disaster resilience. Types of civil infrastructure that the ECI program considers include, but are not limited to, buildings, residential construction, earth and earth retaining structures, and components of flood protection systems; water, waste disposal, and wastewater systems; energy infrastructure (excluding nuclear); and transportation systems (excluding pavements). Both disciplinary and convergent research that can address the challenges of physical civil infrastructure to be resilient and sustainable over its service lifetime are of particular interest. Broader impacts of ECI research include fostering community welfare for an equitable and prosperous nation and promoting environmentally friendly, circular economy policies.\n\r\n\nThe ECI program supports research that advances knowledge on the behavior of physical civil infrastructure subjected to and interacting with the natural environment during construction; under service and long-term conditions, including increased demands due to climate change adaptation and other emerging stressors; and under conditions caused by single or multiple extreme hazard events (extreme weather, windstorms, earthquakes, tsunamis, storm surges, landslides, and fire, including wildland-urban interface fire). The ECI program also supports research on geomaterials and infrastructure materials utilized in load-bearing systems as well as in non-structural systems.

Many programs in the Engineering Directorate support research in environmentally benign manufacturing or chemical processes. The Environmental Sustainability program supports research that would affect more than one chemical or manufacturing process or that takes a systems or holistic approach to green engineering for infrastructure or green buildings. Improvements in distribution and collection systems that will advance smart growth strategies and ameliorate effects of growth are research areas that are supported by Environmental Sustainability. Innovations in management of storm water, recycling and reuse of drinking water, and other green engineering techniques to support sustainability may also be fruitful areas for research.</li>\r\n<li>Ecological engineering:Proposals should focus on the engineering aspects of restoring ecological function to natural systems. Engineering research in the enhancement of natural capital to foster sustainable development is encouraged.</li>\r\n<li>Earth systems engineering:Earth systems engineering considers aspects of large-scale engineering research that involve mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation to climate change, and other global concerns.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\nAll proposed research should be driven by engineering principles, and be presented explicitly in an environmental sustainability context.

Research should focus on critical challenges and opportunities in both new and proven catalysis technologies. Areas of emphasis may include novel catalyst compositions, structures, operating environment, data science tools, theory, and modeling &ndash; preferably in various combinations as dictated by the specific reaction and related knowledge and technology gaps. Target applications include fuels, specialty and bulk chemicals, environmental catalysis, biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals, greenhouse gas mitigation, recycling of waste materials, generation of solar hydrogen, as well as efficient routes to energy utilization.\n\r\n\nHeterogeneous catalysis represents the main thrust of the program. Proposals related to both gas-solid and liquid-solid heterogeneous catalysis are welcome, as are proposals that incorporate concepts from homogeneous catalysis. Recent research trends have highlighted the need for evaluation of catalyst performance and properties under working conditions, especially as supported by advanced in situ and in operando characterization methods. Catalyst synthesizability and stability present additional research opportunities given the harsh operating environments of many catalytic processes. \n\r\n\nTopic areas of particular interest include:\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Energy-related catalysis, utilizing renewable or sustainable energy in lieu of thermal, fossil fuel-based technologies, especially applications in electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and catalytic conversion of biomass-derived chemicals, and also including fuel cell catalysis.</li>\r\n<li>Catalysis aimed at closing the carbon cycle (especially conversion of carbon dioxide, methane, and natural gas to fuels and chemical intermediates).</li>\r\n<li>Heterogeneous catalytic alternatives to traditionally non-catalytic or homogeneous reaction processes, as well as new catalyst designs for established catalytic processes.</li>\r\n<li>Environmental catalysis focused on mitigating both air and water pollutants, and supporting energy-efficient upcycling of waste materials to higher-value products.</li>\r\n<li>Catalytic remediation of feedstocks, process streams, products, or effluents.</li>\r\n<li>Commercially scalable methods of catalyst synthesis, including durable, poison-resistant, and easily regenerable catalyst formulations and designs.</li>\r\n<li>New catalytic materials and architectures (especially those substituting earth-abundant materials for precious and noble metal catalysts).</li>\r\n<li>Basic understanding of catalytic materials, reaction pathways, kinetics, and surface reaction mechanisms.</li>\r\n<li>Advanced tools for catalyst characterization and theoretical/computational catalysis.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\nProposals that deal with new catalytic materials, especially when viewed in light of the inherent complexity of heterogeneous catalytic reactions, will be enhanced by including plans to assess: 1) reproducibility and repeatability of data, 2) stability under realistic operating conditions including start-up and shut-down cycles, 3) performance relative to standard or well-known reference materials, and 4) quantitative, well-accepted measures of catalyst activity, selectivity, and catalytic efficiency, such as turnover frequencies, quantum and/or photon yields of photocatalysts, Faradaic efficiency of electrocatalytic reactions, and detailed product analyses and mass balances for the targeted application.\n\r\n\nNOTE: Proposals that focus on 1) molecular or homogeneous catalysis, 2) the surface science of catalysis, 3) photo redox catalysis, 4) catalytic organic synthesis reactions, and/or 5) fine chemical synthesis and pharmaceutical applications of catalysis may be more appropriately submitted to the Chemical Catalysis program.(CHE 6884) in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences. Proposals focused on biocatalytic processes, including proposals focusing on enzyme engineering, cellular and biomolecular processes, should be submitted to the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering program (CBET 1491). If the proposal focuses on reaction engineering aspects of catalytic processes, submit to the Process Systems, Reaction Engineering, and Molecular Thermodynamics program (CBET 1403). Projects that are interdisciplinary in nature may be jointly funded with other CBET and NSF programs. Program directors will review the submissions and may transfer your proposal to give it the best review situation.\n\r\n\nInnovative proposals outside of these specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.\n\r\n\nINFORMATION COMMON TO MOST CBET PROGRAMS\n\r\n\nProposals should address the novelty and/or<a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/about/transformative_research/faq.jsp\">potentially transformative nature</a>of the proposed work compared to previous work in the field.Also, it is important to address why the proposed work is important in terms of engineering science, as well as to also project the potential impact on society and/or industry of success in the research.The novelty or potentially transformative nature of the research should be included, as a minimum, in the Project Summary of each proposal.\n\r\n\nThe duration of unsolicited proposal awards in CBET is generally up to three years. Single-investigator award budgets typically include support for one graduate student (or equivalent) and up to one month of principal investigator time per year(awards for multiple investigator projects are typically larger). Proposal budgets that are much larger than typical should be discussed with the program director prior to submission. Proposers can view budget amounts and other information from recent awards made by this program via the ?What Has Been Funded (Recent Awards Made Through This Program, with Abstracts)? link towards the bottom of this page.\n\r\n\nFaculty Early Career Development(CAREER)program proposals are strongly encouraged. Award duration is five years.The submission deadline for Engineering CAREER proposals is in July every year. Learn more in the <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/career\">CAREER program description</a>.\n\r\n\nProposals for Conferences, Workshops, and Supplements: PIs are strongly encouraged to discuss their requests with the rogram director before submission of the proposal.\n\r\n\nGrants forRapid Response Research(RAPID)andEArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research(EAGER)are also considered when appropriate. Please note that proposals of these types must be discussed with the program director before submission. Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)proposals that integrate fundamental research with translational results and are consistent with the application areas of interest to each program are also encouraged.

2) the Interfacial Engineering program; and 3) the Process Systems, Reaction Engineering, and Molecular Thermodynamics program.\n\r\n\nThe goals of the Catalysis program are to increase fundamental understanding in catalytic engineering science and to advance the development of catalysts and catalytic reactions that are beneficial to society. Research should focus on critical challenges and opportunities in both new and proven catalysis technologies. Areas of emphasis may include novel catalyst compositions, structures, operating environment, data science tools, theory, and modeling &ndash; preferably in various combinations as dictated by the specific reaction and related knowledge and technology gaps. Target applications include fuels, specialty and bulk chemicals, environmental catalysis, biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals, greenhouse gas mitigation, recycling of waste materials, generation of solar hydrogen, as well as efficient routes to energy utilization.\n\r\n\nHeterogeneous catalysis represents the main thrust of the program. Proposals related to both gas-solid and liquid-solid heterogeneous catalysis are welcome, as are proposals that incorporate concepts from homogeneous catalysis. Recent research trends have highlighted the need for evaluation of catalyst performance and properties under working conditions, especially as supported by advanced in situ and in operando characterization methods. Catalyst synthesizability and stability present additional research opportunities given the harsh operating environments of many catalytic processes. \n\r\n\nTopic areas of particular interest include:\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Energy-related catalysis, utilizing renewable or sustainable energy in lieu of thermal, fossil fuel-based technologies, especially applications in electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and catalytic conversion of biomass-derived chemicals, and also including fuel cell catalysis.</li>\r\n<li>Catalysis aimed at closing the carbon cycle (especially conversion of carbon dioxide, methane, and natural gas to fuels and chemical intermediates).</li>\r\n<li>Heterogeneous catalytic alternatives to traditionally non-catalytic or homogeneous reaction processes, as well as new catalyst designs for established catalytic processes.</li>\r\n<li>Environmental catalysis focused on mitigating both air and water pollutants, and supporting energy-efficient upcycling of waste materials to higher-value products.</li>\r\n<li>Catalytic remediation of feedstocks, process streams, products, or effluents.</li>\r\n<li>Commercially scalable methods of catalyst synthesis, including durable, poison-resistant, and easily regenerable catalyst formulations and designs.</li>\r\n<li>New catalytic materials and architectures (especially those substituting earth-abundant materials for precious and noble metal catalysts).</li>\r\n<li>Basic understanding of catalytic materials, reaction pathways, kinetics, and surface reaction mechanisms.</li>\r\n<li>Advanced tools for catalyst characterization and theoretical/computational catalysis.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\nProposals that deal with new catalytic materials, especially when viewed in light of the inherent complexity of heterogeneous catalytic reactions, will be enhanced by including plans to assess: 1) reproducibility and repeatability of data, 2) stability under realistic operating conditions including start-up and shut-down cycles, 3) performance relative to standard or well-known reference materials, and 4) quantitative, well-accepted measures of catalyst activity, selectivity, and catalytic efficiency, such as turnover frequencies, quantum and/or photon yields of photocatalysts, Faradaic efficiency of electrocatalytic reactions, and detailed product analyses and mass balances for the targeted application.\n\r\n\nNOTE: Proposals that focus on 1) molecular or homogeneous catalysis, 2) the surface science of catalysis, 3) photo redox catalysis, 4) catalytic organic synthesis reactions, and/or 5) fine chemical synthesis and pharmaceutical applications of catalysis may be more appropriately submitted to the Chemical Catalysis program.(CHE 6884) in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences. Proposals focused on biocatalytic processes, including proposals focusing on enzyme engineering, cellular and biomolecular processes, should be submitted to the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering program (CBET 1491). If the proposal focuses on reaction engineering aspects of catalytic processes, submit to the Process Systems, Reaction Engineering, and Molecular Thermodynamics program (CBET 1403). Projects that are interdisciplinary in nature may be jointly funded with other CBET and NSF programs. Program directors will review the submissions and may transfer your proposal to give it the best review situation.\n\r\n\nInnovative proposals outside of these specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.\n\r\n\nINFORMATION COMMON TO MOST CBET PROGRAMS\n\r\n\nProposals should address the novelty and/or<a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/about/transformative_research/faq.jsp\">potentially transformative nature</a>of the proposed work compared to previous work in the field.Also, it is important to address why the proposed work is important in terms of engineering science, as well as to also project the potential impact on society and/or industry of success in the research.The novelty or potentially transformative nature of the research should be included, as a minimum, in the Project Summary of each proposal.\n\r\n\nThe duration of unsolicited proposal awards in CBET is generally up to three years. Single-investigator award budgets typically include support for one graduate student (or equivalent) and up to one month of principal investigator time per year(awards for multiple investigator projects are typically larger). Proposal budgets that are much larger than typical should be discussed with the program director prior to submission. Proposers can view budget amounts and other information from recent awards made by this program via the ?What Has Been Funded (Recent Awards Made Through This Program, with Abstracts)? link towards the bottom of this page.\n\r\n\nFaculty Early Career Development(CAREER)program proposals are strongly encouraged.

The overarching goal of this NOFO is to unlock a wave of follow-on investment in low-carbon power and low-carbon industrial products by increasing the capital flow to sectors where it is already occurring and by expanding the CCUS market to additional power, industrial, and commercial applications. Awards made under this NOFO will be funded with funds appropriated by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, more commonly known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). \n\nThe BIL will invest up to $2.537 billion to fund domestic CCUS demonstration and commercial-scale projects that further the development, deployment, and commercialization of technologies to capture and geologically store CO2 emissions. In addition, the BIL has a total appropriation of $937 million for fiscal years (FY) 2022 through 2025 for large-scale pilot projects that accelerate the development, deployment, and commercialization of innovative and transformative carbon capture technologies.\n \nThis NOFO makes available up to $1,300,000,000 for approximately 10 projects at maximum Federal cost shares ranging from 50% to 80%, depending on the Topic Area and Phase of the project. The NOFO is divided into three Topic Areas based on the technology readiness level (TRL) and scope of the proposed project. DOE will select projects that seek to demonstrate the following, based on the chosen Topic Area:\n•\tTopic Area 1 – The technical and commercial viability of established carbon capture technologies (TRL >7) in both new applications and at commercial scale. \n•\tTopic Area 2 – First-of-a-kind transformational technologies (TRL 5–6) at the large pilot scale.\n•\tTopic Area 3 – Region-specific carbon management networks with multiple emitters to reduce offtake uncertainty and increase emitter access to storage facilities.\n\nAll applications, concept paper, forms, and instructions are available on OCED eXCHANGE.

The NOFO and any cooperative agreements or grants made under this NOFO are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910.</p>\n<p>ARPA-E funds research on, and the development of, transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/.</p>\n<p>ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established “learning curves” where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive improvements to the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. In contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly better than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E will provide support at the highest funding level only for submissions with significant technology risk, aggressive timetables, and careful management and mitigation of the associated risks.</p>\n<p>ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive – that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale.</p>\n<p>ARPA-E funds applied research and development (R&amp;D). The Office of Management and Budget defines “applied research” as an “original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge…directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective” and defines “experimental development” as “creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.”0F1 Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as “experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts”)1 should contact the DOE’s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity).</p>\n<p>ARPA-E encourages submissions stemming from ideas that still require proof-of-concept R&amp;D efforts as well as those for which some proof-of-concept demonstration already exists. Submissions can propose a project with the end deliverable being an extremely creative, but partial solution.</p>\n<p>PROGRAM OVERVIEW</p>\n<p>The Seeding Critical Advances for Leading Energy technologies with Untapped Potential (SCALEUP) Ready program provides a vital mechanism for the support of innovative energy R&amp;D that complements ARPA-E’s primary focus on early-stage transformational energy technologies that require proof of concept.</p>\n<p>Technologies that achieve substantial technical advancement under ARPA-E support may still face significant technical and commercial challenges upon completion of an award''s funding period, and thus are at risk of being stranded in their development path once ARPA-E funding ends. Experience across ARPA-E’s diverse energy portfolios, and input from a wide range of investors and industry stakeholders, indicate that pre-commercial scaling projects are critical to establish practical performance and cost parameters. These pre-commercial scaling projects aim to 1) translate the performance achieved at bench scale to commercially scalable versions of the technology, 2) integrate the technology with broader systems, 3) provide extended performance data, and 4) validate the manufacturability and reliability of new energy technologies. Successful scaling projects should enable industry stakeholders to justify the substantial commitments of financial resources, personnel, manufacturing facilities, and materials necessary to subsequently deploy the technologies at a commercial scale.</p>\n<p>SCALEUP Ready seeks to scale the most promising technologies previously funded by ARPA-E. The possibility of ARPA-E-funded technologies becoming stranded along their development pathways leaves substantial intellectual property developed with American taxpayer dollars vulnerable to adoption by foreign competitors, who capture it for continued development and economic benefit overseas. This harms national competitiveness, as U.S. industries often fall behind on the development, scaling, and manufacturing of technologies necessary to compete in rapidly evolving global energy markets. Thus, projects selected for SCALEUP Ready will meet ARPA-E’s statutory goals by “accelerating transformational technological advances in areas that industry by itself is not likely to undertake because of technical and financial uncertainty.\"</p>", "agencyDetails": {"code": "ARPAE", "seed": "DOE-ARPAE", "agencyCode": "DOE-ARPAE", "agencyName": "Advanced Research Projects Agency Energy ", "topAgencyCode": "DOE"}, "opportunityId": 356623, "applicantTypes": [{"id": "99", "description": "Unrestricted (i.e., open to any type of entity above), subject to any clarification in text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\""}], "archiveDateStr": "2029-10-29-00-00-00", "postingDateStr": "2024-10-02-00-00-00", "createTimeStamp": "Feb 11, 2025 11:52:53 AM EST", "lastUpdatedDate": "Feb 11, 2025 11:52:53 AM EST", "responseDateStr": "2029-09-29-00-00-00", "responseDateDesc": "Open continuously until otherwise amended.", "topAgencyDetails": {"code": "DOE", "seed": "DOE", "agencyCode": "DOE", "agencyName": "Department of Energy", "topAgencyCode": "DOE"}, "agencyAddressDesc": "ARPA-E CO", "agencyContactDesc": "ARPA-E CO", "agencyContactName": "Jennifer A Fleming\nGrantor", "agencyContactEmail": "ARPA-E-CO@hq.doe.gov", "agencyContactPhone": "240-885-2793", "createTimeStampStr": "2025-02-11-11-52-53", "fundingDescLinkUrl": "https://arpa-e-foa.energy.gov", "fundingInstruments": [{"id": "CA", "description": "Cooperative Agreement"}, {"id": "O", "description": "Other"}], "awardFloorFormatted": "5,000,000", "fundingDescLinkDesc": "ARPA-E", "awardCeilingFormatted": "20,000,000", "agencyContactEmailDesc": "ARPA-E CO", "applicantEligibilityDesc": "See Section II.A. of the NOFO.", "fundingActivityCategories": [{"id": "OZ", "description": "Opportunity Zone Benefits"}, {"id": "ST", "description": "Science and Technology and other Research and Development"}]}, "assistURL": "", "draftMode": "N", "relatedOpps": [], "publisherUid": "jafleming191", "agencyDetails": {"code": "ARPAE", "seed": "DOE-ARPAE", "agencyCode": "DOE-ARPAE", "agencyName": "Advanced Research Projects Agency Energy ", "topAgencyCode": "DOE"}, "errorMessages": [], "opportunityPkgs": [], "originalDueDate": "Sep 29, 2029 12:00:00 AM EDT", "assistCompatible": false, "opportunityTitle": "SEEDING CRITICAL ADVANCES FOR LEADING ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES WITH UNTAPPED POTENTIAL (SCALEUP) READY", "owningAgencyCode": "DOE-ARPAE", "topAgencyDetails": {"code": "DOE", "seed": "DOE", "agencyCode": "DOE", "agencyName": "Department of Energy", "topAgencyCode": "DOE"}, "forecastHistCount": 0, "opportunityNumber": "DE-FOA-0003467", "synPostDateInPast": true, "synopsisHistCount": 2, "opportunityCategory": {"category": "D", "description": "Discretionary"}, "originalDueDateDesc": "Open continuously until otherwise amended.", "synAttChangeComments": [], "synopsisDocumentURLs": [], "closedOpportunityPkgs": [], "forecastModifiedFields": [], "synopsisModifiedFields": ["revision", "version", "synopsisDesc", "createTimeStamp"], "opportunityHistoryDetails": [{"cfdas": [{"id": 424033, "revision": 1, "cfdaNumber": "81.135", "programTitle": "Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy", "opportunityId": 356623}], "listed": "L", "revision": 0, "synopsis": {"id": {"revision": 0, "opportunityId": 356623}, "version": 2, "revision": 0, "sendEmail": "Y", "actionDate": "Oct 03, 2024 11:17:11 AM EDT", "actionType": "U", "agencyCode": "DOE-ARPAE", "awardFloor": "0", "archiveDate": "Oct 29, 2029 12:00:00 AM EDT", "costSharing": true, "createdDate": "Oct 02, 2024 01:43:21 PM EDT", "postingDate": "Oct 02, 2024 12:00:00 AM EDT", "awardCeiling": "20000000", "responseDate": "Sep 29, 2029 12:00:00 AM EDT", "synopsisDesc": "<p>To obtain a copy of the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) please go to the ARPA-E website at https://arpa-e-foa.energy.gov.&nbsp;To apply to this NOFO, Applicants must register with and submit application materials through ARPA-E eXCHANGE (<a href=\"https://arpa-e-foa.energy.gov/Registration.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">https://arpa-e-foa.energy.gov/Registration.aspx</a>).&nbsp;For detailed guidance on using ARPA-E eXCHANGE, please refer to the ARPA-E eXCHANGE User Guide (https://arpa-e-foa.energy.gov/Manuals.aspx).&nbsp;ARPA-E will not review or consider concept papers submitted through other means.

Part 910.</p> \n<p>ARPA-E funds research on, and the development of, transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/.</p> \n<p>ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established “learning curves” where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive improvements to the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. In contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly better than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E will provide support at the highest funding level only for submissions with significant technology risk, aggressive timetables, and careful management and mitigation of the associated risks.</p> \n<p>ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive – that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale.</p> \n<p>ARPA-E funds applied research and development (R&amp;D). The Office of Management and Budget defines “applied research” as an “original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge…directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective” and defines “experimental development” as “creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.”0F1 Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as “experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts”)1 should contact the DOE’s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity).</p> \n<p>ARPA-E encourages submissions stemming from ideas that still require proof-of-concept R&amp;D efforts as well as those for which some proof-of-concept demonstration already exists. Submissions can propose a project with the end deliverable being an extremely creative, but partial solution.</p> \n<p>PROGRAM OVERVIEW</p> \n<p>The Seeding Critical Advances for Leading Energy technologies with Untapped Potential (SCALEUP) Ready program provides a vital mechanism for the support of innovative energy R&amp;D that complements ARPA-E’s primary focus on early-stage transformational energy technologies that require proof of concept.</p> \n<p>Technologies that achieve substantial technical advancement under ARPA-E support may still face significant technical and commercial challenges upon completion of an award''s funding period, and thus are at risk of being stranded in their development path once ARPA-E funding ends. Experience across ARPA-E’s diverse energy portfolios, and input from a wide range of investors and industry stakeholders, indicate that pre-commercial scaling projects are critical to establish practical performance and cost parameters. These pre-commercial scaling projects aim to 1) translate the performance achieved at bench scale to commercially scalable versions of the technology, 2) integrate the technology with broader systems, 3) provide extended performance data, and 4) validate the manufacturability and reliability of new energy technologies. Successful scaling projects should enable industry stakeholders to justify the substantial commitments of financial resources, personnel, manufacturing facilities, and materials necessary to subsequently deploy the technologies at a commercial scale.</p> \n<p>SCALEUP Ready seeks to scale the most promising technologies previously funded by ARPA-E. The possibility of ARPA-E-funded technologies becoming stranded along their development pathways leaves substantial intellectual property developed with American taxpayer dollars vulnerable to adoption by foreign competitors, who capture it for continued development and economic benefit overseas. This harms national competitiveness, as U.S. industries often fall behind on the development, scaling, and manufacturing of technologies necessary to compete in rapidly evolving global energy markets. Thus, projects selected for SCALEUP Ready will meet ARPA-E’s statutory goals by “accelerating transformational technological advances in areas that industry by itself is not likely to undertake because of technical and financial uncertainty.\"</p>", "agencyDetails": {"code": "ARPAE", "seed": "DOE-ARPAE", "agencyCode": "DOE-ARPAE", "agencyName": "Advanced Research Projects Agency Energy ", "topAgencyCode": "DOE"}, "opportunityId": 356623, "applicantTypes": [{"id": "99", "description": "Unrestricted (i.e., open to any type of entity above), subject to any clarification in text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\""}], "archiveDateStr": "2029-10-29-00-00-00", "postingDateStr": "2024-10-02-00-00-00", "createTimeStamp": "Oct 02, 2024 01:50:57 PM EDT", "lastUpdatedDate": "Oct 02, 2024 01:50:57 PM EDT", "responseDateStr": "2029-09-29-00-00-00", "responseDateDesc": "Open continuously until otherwise amended.", "agencyAddressDesc": "ARPA-E CO", "agencyContactDesc": "ARPA-E CO", "agencyContactName": "Jennifer A Fleming\nGrantor", "agencyContactEmail": "ARPA-E-CO@hq.doe.gov", "agencyContactPhone": "240-885-2793", "createTimeStampStr": "2024-10-02-13-50-57", "fundingDescLinkUrl": "https://arpa-e-foa.energy.gov", "fundingInstruments": [{"id": "CA", "description": "Cooperative Agreement"}, {"id": "O", "description": "Other"}], "awardFloorFormatted": "0", "fundingDescLinkDesc": "ARPA-E", "awardCeilingFormatted": "20,000,000", "agencyContactEmailDesc": "ARPA-E CO", "applicantEligibilityDesc": "See Section II.A. of the NOFO.", "fundingActivityCategories": [{"id": "OZ", "description": "Opportunity Zone Benefits"}, {"id": "ST", "description": "Science and Technology and other Research and Development"}]}, "oppHistId": {"revision": 0, "opportunityId": 356623}, "publisherUid": "jafleming191", "opportunityId": 356623, "opportunityTitle": "SEEDING CRITICAL ADVANCES FOR LEADING ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES WITH UNTAPPED POTENTIAL (SCALEUP) READY", "owningAgencyCode": "DOE-ARPAE", "opportunityNumber": "DE-FOA-0003467", "opportunityCategory": {"category": "D", "description": "Discretionary"}, "forecastModifiedFields": [], "synopsisModifiedFields": []}, {"cfdas": [{"id": 424033, "revision": 1, "cfdaNumber": "81.135", "programTitle": "Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy", "opportunityId": 356623}], "listed": "L", "revision": 1, "synopsis": {"id": {"revision": 1, "opportunityId": 356623}, "version": 3, "revision": 1, "sendEmail": "Y", "actionDate": "Feb 11, 2025 11:52:53 AM EST", "actionType": "U", "agencyCode": "DOE-ARPAE", "awardFloor": "5000000", "archiveDate": "Oct 29, 2029 12:00:00 AM EDT", "costSharing": true, "createdDate": "Oct 02, 2024 01:43:21 PM EDT", "modComments": "The purpose of this modification is to correct the amount cited for the Award Floor ceiling to match the amount in the NOFO document.", "postingDate": "Oct 02, 2024 12:00:00 AM EDT", "awardCeiling": "20000000", "responseDate": "Sep 29, 2029 12:00:00 AM EDT", "synopsisDesc": "<p>To obtain a copy of the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) please go to the ARPA-E website at https://arpa-e-foa.energy.gov.&nbsp;To apply to this NOFO, Applicants must register with and submit application materials through ARPA-E eXCHANGE (<a href=\"https://arpa-e-foa.energy.gov/Registration.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">https://arpa-e-foa.energy.gov/Registration.aspx</a>).&nbsp;For detailed guidance on using ARPA-E eXCHANGE, please refer to the ARPA-E eXCHANGE User Guide (https://arpa-e-foa.energy.gov/Manuals.aspx).&nbsp;ARPA-E will not review or consider concept papers submitted through other means.

To date, the COPS Office has been appropriated more than $21 billion to advance community policing, including grants awarded to more than 13,000 state, local, territorial, and tribal law enforcement agencies to fund the hiring and redeployment of nearly 140,000 officers.\n\nCOPS Office information resources, covering a wide range of community policing topics such as school and campus safety, violent crime, and officer safety and wellness, can be downloaded via the COPS Office’s home page, https://cops.usdoj.gov. \nThe FY25 School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) provides funding directly to states, units of local government, Indian tribes, and their public agencies to improve security at schools and on school grounds in the recipient’s jurisdiction through evidence-based school safety programs. The COPS Office anticipates that up to $73,000,000 will be available for up to $500,000 per award, with approximately 200 awards anticipated. A local cost share (matching funds) of at least 25 percent in the form of cash is required unless a match waiver is requested and approved, and the period of performance duration will be 36 months, with a period of performance start date of 10/1/25.\nApproximately $1 million of the available funding will be reserved for microgrants for school districts, including rural, tribal, and low-resourced schools. Applications for microgrants must not exceed $100,000, and the COPS Office will waive the 25 percent local cost share (matching funds) requirement for microgrant applicants that are selected for funding. Consideration for microgrant funding does not exclude your agency from consideration from non-microgrant SVPP funding. \n\nApplications should demonstrate a comprehensive approach to school safety and activities must fall within one of the statutory purpose areas (see 34 U.S.C. § 10551(b)(5)–(9)):\n•\tCoordination with local law enforcement;\n•\tTraining for local law enforcement officers to prevent student violence against others and self;\n•\tPlacement and use of metal detectors, locks, lighting, and other deterrent measures;\n•\tAcquisition and installation of technology for expedited notification of local law enforcement during an emergency;\n•\tAny other measure that, in the determination of the COPS Office Director, may provide a significant improvement in security.", "agencyDetails": {"code": "COPS", "seed": "USDOJ-OJP-COPS", "agencyCode": "USDOJ-OJP-COPS", "agencyName": "Community Oriented Policing Services", "topAgencyCode": "USDOJ"}, "opportunityId": 358757, "applicantTypes": [{"id": "02", "description": "City or township governments"}, {"id": "05", "description": "Independent school districts"}, {"id": "01", "description": "County governments"}, {"id": "07", "description": "Native American tribal governments (Federally recognized)"}, {"id": "25", "description": "Others (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"}, {"id": "00", "description": "State governments"}], "numberOfAwards": "200", "postingDateStr": "2025-04-24-00-00-00", "createTimeStamp": "Apr 24, 2025 06:23:34 PM EDT", "lastUpdatedDate": "Apr 24, 2025 06:23:34 PM EDT", "responseDateStr": "2025-06-18-00-00-00", "estimatedFunding": "73000000", "topAgencyDetails": {"code": "USDOJ", "seed": "USDOJ", "agencyCode": "USDOJ", "agencyName": "Department of Justice", "topAgencyCode": "USDOJ"}, "agencyAddressDesc": "COPS Office Response Center", "agencyContactDesc": "COPS Office Response Center\nAskCOPSRC@usdoj.gov", "agencyContactName": "Community Oriented Policing Services", "agencyContactEmail": "AskCOPSRC@usdoj.gov", "agencyContactPhone": "800-421-6770", "createTimeStampStr": "2025-04-24-18-23-34", "fundingDescLinkUrl": "https://cops.usdoj.gov/grants", "fundingInstruments": [{"id": "G", "description": "Grant"}], "awardFloorFormatted": "0", "fundingDescLinkDesc": "COPS Grants", "awardCeilingFormatted": "500,000", "agencyContactEmailDesc": "COPS Office Response Center", "applicantEligibilityDesc": "The following entities are eligible to apply under this program; States, units of local government, Indian tribes, and their public agencies, including\tschool districts, including public charter schools and school districts with a single school; school boards; law enforcement agencies.

This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. By contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly lower than that of the incumbent technology.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><em>ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace</em></strong>. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive – that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><em>ARPA-E funds applied research and development. </em></strong>The Office of Management and Budget defines “applied research” as an “original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge…directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective” and defines “experimental development” as “creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.” (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy (http://fossil.energy.gov/), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (http://energy.gov/oe/office-electricity-delivery-and-energy-reliability).&nbsp;Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as “experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts”)&nbsp;should contact the DOE’s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere.

The focused programs have significant potential impact on one or more of the statutory goals described in Section I.A of the FOA. Awards made in response to the solicitation for focused programs support the aggressive technical targets established in that solicitation. Taken in total, ARPA-E’s focused programs cover a broad swath of energy technologies and applications.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>However, ARPA-E wants to ensure that there are opportunities to support innovative energy R&amp;D in new and emerging fields that either fall outside of the focused technology programs or that develop after those programs have closed. Within this general framework, ARPA-E seeks transformative ideas that enable the most efficient, economical, sustainable, and environmentally benign utilization of energy. Useful energy can take many forms, including radiant energy from lights, electrical energy for appliances, thermal energy to heat homes, mechanical energy for transportation, chemical energy in the form of food, and energy used to manufacture products.</p> <p><br></p> <p><span style=\"color: black;\">To view the FOA in its entirety, please visit https://arpa-e-foa.energy.gov.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color: black;\"> </span></p> <p><span style=\"color: black;\"> </span></p> <p> &nbsp;</p>", "agencyDetails": {"code": "ARPAE", "seed": "DOE-ARPAE", "agencyCode": "DOE-ARPAE", "agencyName": "Advanced Research Projects Agency Energy ", "topAgencyCode": "DOE"}, "opportunityId": 350952, "applicantTypes": [{"id": "99", "description": "Unrestricted (i.e., open to any type of entity above), subject to any clarification in text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\""}], "archiveDateStr": "2029-12-30-00-00-00", "postingDateStr": "2023-11-09-00-00-00", "createTimeStamp": "Aug 31, 2024 04:21:57 PM EDT", "lastUpdatedDate": "Aug 31, 2024 04:21:57 PM EDT", "responseDateStr": "2029-09-30-00-00-00", "estimatedFunding": "10000000", "agencyAddressDesc": "ARPA-E CO", "agencyContactDesc": "ARPA-E CO", "agencyContactName": "Jennifer A Fleming\nGrantor", "agencyContactEmail": "arpa-e-co@hq.doe.gov", "agencyContactPhone": "240-885-2793", "createTimeStampStr": "2024-08-31-16-21-57", "fundingDescLinkUrl": "https://arpa-e-foa.energy.gov", "fundingInstruments": [{"id": "G", "description": "Grant"}], "awardFloorFormatted": "0", "fundingDescLinkDesc": "ARPA-E eXCHANGE", "awardCeilingFormatted": "500,000", "agencyContactEmailDesc": "ARPA-E CO", "applicantEligibilityDesc": "See Section III.A of the FOA", "estimatedFundingFormatted": "10,000,000", "fundingActivityCategories": [{"id": "OZ", "description": "Opportunity Zone Benefits"}, {"id": "ST", "description": "Science and Technology and other Research and Development"}]}, "oppHistId": {"revision": 1, "opportunityId": 350952}, "publisherUid": "bbeyer444", "opportunityId": 350952, "modifiedComments": "Amendment 1 to both Concept Paper FOA & Full Application FOA", "opportunityTitle": "SPURRING PROJECTS TO ADVANCE ENERGY RESEARCH AND KNOWLEDGE SWIFTLY (SPARKS)", "owningAgencyCode": "DOE-ARPAE", "opportunityNumber": "DE-FOA-0003164", "opportunityCategory": {"category": "D", "description": "Discretionary"}, "forecastModifiedFields": [], "synopsisModifiedFields": ["revision", "version", "synopsisDesc", "createTimeStamp"]}], "synopsisAttachmentFolders": []}, "token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.InZTblZ3MVVqYXduNVRLd1dwc3psd0UvMlNzZFpud0ZWSHlVWGpMTXd1b1E9Ig.iRmsKAMO6izD-Wt3UK7ivAYmIwAvmbYQE7siRA2hb_8", "errorcode": 0}]', '{"source": {"id": "7767eedc-8a09-4058-8837-fc8df8e437cb", "url": "https://www.grants.gov/search-grants", "name": "Grants.gov", "type": "federal", "notes": "Two-stage API system: 1) Search API for opportunity listings 2) Detail API requires separate calls using opportunity IDs for full details", "active": true, "priority": 5, "auth_type": "none", "created_at": "2025-03-29T21:21:19.251067+00:00", "updated_at": "2025-04-30T01:18:56.333169+00:00", "api_endpoint": "https://api.grants.gov/v1/api/search2", "auth_details": {}, "handler_type": "standard", "last_checked": "2025-04-30T01:18:56.329+00:00", "organization": "General Services Administration (GSA)", "update_frequency": "daily", "api_documentation_url": "https://www.grants.gov/api"}, "timestamp": "2025-06-08T22:08:25.050Z", "processingInstructions": {"apiNotes": "Two-stage API system: 1) Search API for opportunity listings 2) Detail API requires separate calls using opportunity IDs for full details", "workflow": "two_step_api", "authMethod": "none", "apiEndpoint": "https://api.grants.gov/v1/api/search2", "authDetails": {}, "handlerType": "standard", "requestBody": {"keyword": "energy; building; mobility; solar; battery; modernization; hvac; lighting; water; climate; carbon; school; infrastructure; roof; transportation; construction", "oppStatuses": "forecasted|posted"}, "detailConfig": {"method": "POST", "enabled": true, "headers": {"Content-Type": "application/json"}, "idField": "id", "idParam": "opportunityId", "endpoint": "https://api.grants.gov/v1/api/fetchOpportunity"}, "executionTime": 1, "requestConfig": {"method": "POST", "headers": {"Content-Type": "application/json"}}, "responseConfig": {"totalCountPath": "data.hitCount", "responseDataPath": "data.oppHits"}, "processingNotes": ["Analysis completed for Grants.gov"], "queryParameters": {}, "responseMapping": {}, "paginationConfig": {"type": "offset", "inBody": true, "enabled": true, "maxPages": 1, "pageSize": 3, "limitParam": "rows", "offsetParam": "startRecordNum"}}}', '2025-06-08 22:08:25.064+00', false, NULL, '2025-06-08 22:08:25.064+00', 'a8a7bb58e6ef46c49af1d20e2f31a14050f859893485fff16b0d982dbb0334e5'),

Processes utilizing electrochemistry or photochemistry for sustainable energy and chemical production must be scalable, environmentally benign, reduce greenhouse gas production, and utilize renewable resources. Research projects that stress fundamental understanding of phenomena that directly impact key barriers to improved system or component-level performance (for example, energy efficiency, product yield, process intensification) are encouraged. Processes for energy storage should address fundamental research barriers for renewable electricity storage applications, for transport propulsion, or for other applications that could have impact towards climate change mitigation. For projects concerning energy storage materials, proposals should involve testable hypotheses that involve device or component performance characteristics that are tied to fundamental understanding of transport, kinetics, or thermodynamics. Advanced chemistries beyond lithium-ion are encouraged. Proposed research on processes utilizing electrochemistry or photochemistry should be inspired by the need for economic and impactful conversion processes.\n\r\n\nAll proposal project descriptions should address how the proposed work, if successful, will improve process realization and economic feasibility and compare the proposed work against current state of the art. Highly integrated multidisciplinary projects are encouraged. When appropriate, collaborations with industrial technologists are encouraged through GOALI proposals. Collaborative projects with an integrated experimental and theoretical approach are also encouraged.\n\r\n\nTopics of interest include electrochemical energy storage and electrochemical production/conversion systems. Radically new battery systems can move the U.S. more rapidly toward a more sustainable transportation future and to greater renewable electricity production penetration. High-energy density and high-power density batteries suitable for transportation and renewable energy storage applications are of primary interest. Advanced systems involving metal anodes, solid-state electrolytes, nonaqueous systemsbeyond lithium, aqueous systems beyond lithium,and multivalent chemistries are encouraged. Research activities focused on commercially available systems such as lead-acid and nickel-metal hydride batteries or lithium-ion batteries for medical or consumer electronics applications will not be considered by this program. Novel electrochemical and photochemical systems and processes for the production of chemicals and high-value products are encouraged. Emphasis is placed on those systems that improve process intensification and process modularization with accompanying benefits in energy efficiency and environmental footprint.\n\r\n\nAdditional fundamental science topics of interest to this program include the study of:\n\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>advanced fuel cell systems or fuel cell components for transportation propulsion or grid energy storage applications;</li>\r\n<li>flow batteries for stationary energy storage applications including alternative redox chemistries (e.g., organic, inorganic, organometallic, macromolecular) and operating strategies (e.g., redox-mediation, suspensions); and</li>\r\n<li>photocatalytic or photoelectrochemical processes and devices for the splitting of water into hydrogen gas or for the reduction of carbon dioxide to liquid or gaseous fuels. Projects that largely focus on developing fundamental understanding of the catalytic reaction mechanisms and structure-function relationships may be more appropriate as submissions to the CBET Catalysis program (CBET 1401).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\nProjects submitted to the Electrochemical Systems program are expected to develop fundamental, molecular-level understanding of the key chemical reaction and transport phenomena barriers to improved system-level performance. Innovative proposals outside of these specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.\n\r\n\nReferrals to other programs within NSF:\n\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Proposals that focus on electric-field driven separations such as dielectrophoresis should be directed to theInterfacial Engineeringprogram (CBET 1417).</li>\r\n<li>Proposals that focus on thermal management of energy storage devices and systems should be submitted to theThermal Transport Processesprogram (CBET 1406).</li>\r\n<li>Proposals that focus on improving device and system performance of primarily organic, inorganic, and hybrid photovoltaic (PV) technologies, including perovskites, may be more appropriate as submissions to the Electronics, Photonics, and Magnetic Devices program in Engineering''s Division of Electrical, Communications, and Cyber Systems (ECCS 1517).

Also, it is important to address why the proposed work is important in terms of engineering science, as well as to also project the potential impact on society and/or industry of success in the research. The novelty or potentially transformative nature of the research should be included, as a minimum, in the Project Summary of each proposal.\n\r\n\nThe duration of unsolicited proposal awards in CBET is generally up to three years. Single-investigator award budgets typically include support for one graduate student (or equivalent) and up to one month of principal investigator time per year(awards for multiple investigator projects are typically larger). Proposal budgets that are much larger than typical should be discussed with the Program Director prior to submission. Proposers can view budget amounts and other information from recent awards made by this program via the &ldquo;What Has Been Funded (Recent Awards Made Through This Program, with Abstracts)&rdquo; link towards the bottom of this page.\n\r\n\nFaculty Early Career Development(CAREER)program proposals are strongly encouraged.

The ECI program also supports research on geomaterials and infrastructure materials utilized in load-bearing systems as well as in non-structural systems. Of particular interest is experimental and analytical/computational research to advance the fundamental understanding of coupled multi-physics, multi-scale (spatial and temporal), multi-functional behavior of these materials and their intended use in civil infrastructure.\n\r\n\nThe ECI program supports research on civil infrastructure that contributes to the National Science Foundation&rsquo;s role in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) and the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP).

Of particular interest is experimental and analytical/computational research to advance the fundamental understanding of coupled multi-physics, multi-scale (spatial and temporal), multi-functional behavior of these materials and their intended use in civil infrastructure.\n\r\n\nThe ECI program supports research on civil infrastructure that contributes to the National Science Foundation&rsquo;s role in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) and the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP). Principal Investigators are encouraged to leverage NSF&rsquo;s investments in the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) experimental, computational modeling and simulation, and data resources (<a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://www.designsafe-ci.org/\">https://www.designsafe-ci.org/</a>) in their research to accelerate advances needed for reducing the impacts of natural hazards on civil infrastructure. The NHERI Science Plan (<a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://www.designsafe-ci.org/facilities/nco/science-plan/\">https://www.designsafe-ci.org/facilities/nco/science-plan/</a>) offers a range of research topics that could benefit from the use of NHERI resources and are relevant to the ECI program.\n\r\n\nThe ECI program does not support research that addresses natural resource exploration or recovery, investigates blasts and explosions, develops sensor and measurement technologies, or focuses on hazard characterization. The ECI program only supports fundamental research topics for civil infrastructure with a strong grounding in theory. Topics which fall within the mission for research and/or development of other federal and state agencies are appropriate for the ECI program only when addressing fundamental scientific questions. Research on natural hazard characterization is supported through programs in the NSF Directorate for Geosciences.\n\r\n\nProposers are actively encouraged to email a one-page project summary to the ECI Program Officers before submitting a full proposal for guidance on whether the proposed research topic falls within the scope of the ECI program; this guidance especially should be requested for multi-disciplinary research proposals, proposals for which research and/or development on the subject civil infrastructure(s) are also supported by other federal and state agencies, and proposals that consider civil infrastructure not listed above.", "agencyDetails": {"code": "NSF", "seed": "NSF", "agencyCode": "NSF", "agencyName": "U.S. National Science Foundation", "topAgencyCode": "NSF"}, "opportunityId": 306169, "applicantTypes": [{"id": "99", "description": "Unrestricted (i.e., open to any type of entity above), subject to any clarification in text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\""}], "postingDateStr": "2018-06-12-00-00-00", "createTimeStamp": "May 19, 2023 11:53:32 PM EDT", "lastUpdatedDate": "May 19, 2023 11:53:32 PM EDT", "responseDateDesc": "Proposals accepted anytime", "agencyAddressDesc": "If you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.", "agencyContactDesc": "NSF grants.gov support\ngrantsgovsupport@nsf.gov", "agencyContactName": "National Science Foundation", "agencyContactEmail": "grantsgovsupport@nsf.gov", "agencyContactPhone": "703-292-4261", "createTimeStampStr": "2023-05-19-23-53-32", "fundingDescLinkUrl": "http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505488", "fundingInstruments": [{"id": "G", "description": "Grant"}], "fundingDescLinkDesc": "NSF Program Desccription PD-19-073Y", "agencyContactEmailDesc": "If you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above.", "fundingActivityCategories": [{"id": "ST", "description": "Science and Technology and other Research and Development"}]}, "oppHistId": {"revision": 6, "opportunityId": 306169}, "publisherUid": "NSFServices", "opportunityId": 306169, "opportunityTitle": "Engineering for Civil Infrastructure", "owningAgencyCode": "NSF", "opportunityNumber": "PD-19-073Y", "opportunityCategory": {"category": "D", "description": "Discretionary"}, "forecastModifiedFields": [], "synopsisModifiedFields": ["revision", "version", "createTimeStamp"]}], "synopsisAttachmentFolders": []}, "token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.IkRybUxnM2RTN3ZTaVlzVDdzRlpVRVNKWmhwclFRRCtiQWUxQnRHcWtHdU09Ig.8Rb_ZQAgmVjVIYs7eWjfcgWXJEC49QpJoITneTVdHB4", "errorcode": 0}, {"msg": "Webservice Succeeds", "data": {"id": 348258, "cfdas": [{"id": 411261, "cfdaNumber": "47.041", "programTitle": "Engineering", "opportunityId": 348258}, {"id": 411262, "opportunityId": 348258}], "listed": "L", "docType": "synopsis", "flag2006": "N", "revision": 1, "synopsis": {"version": 2, "sendEmail": "N", "agencyCode": "NSF", "agencyName": "National Science Foundation", "awardFloor": "none", "agencyPhone": "703-292-4261", "costSharing": false, "createdDate": "May 19, 2023 11:57:38 PM EDT", "modComments": ".", "postingDate": "May 19, 2023 12:00:00 AM EDT", "awardCeiling": "none", "synopsisDesc": "The Energy, Power, Control, andNetworks (EPCN) Program supports innovative research in modeling, optimization, learning, adaptation, and control of networked multi-agent systems, higher-level decision making, and dynamic resource allocation, as well as risk management in the presence of uncertainty, sub-system failures, and stochastic disturbances.

The California Natural Resources Agency (Agency) prescribes procedures and criteria to evaluate grant project proposals and submits a list of projects recommended for funding to the California Transportation Commission (CTC). The CTC awards grants to projects from Agency’s list.  Related Transportation Facility  EEM projects must mitigate, either directly or indirectly, the environmental impacts of a) the modification of an existing Transportation Facility or b) the construction of a new Transportation Facility (hereafter Related Transportation Facility or RTF). The EEM project can be the required mitigation for the RTF or enhancement to mitigation required for the RTF.  Statewide Project Goals  Agency grant programs assist state and local entities to develop more sustainable communities, increase adaptability to climate change using nature-based strategies, and protect biodiversity in compliance with Executive Order N-82-20, the Pathways to 30 x 30 California, and the Natural and Working Lands Climate Smart Strategy. Projects that demonstrate the following multiple benefits will be more competitive:  • Improved air and/or water quality.  • Reduced consumption of natural resources and energy.  • Increased reliability of local water supplies.  • Increased adaptability to climate change.  • Increased protection and restoration of biodiversity  Eligible Projects Examples  The list below isn''t comprehensive, but provides examples of project elements that meet statutory conditions.  Urban Forestry:  • Planting of trees and plants along urban streets and medians.  • Greening existing public lands and structures, including school campuses and urban parks.  • Greening vacant lots and abandoned sites.  • Restoration of urban creeks.  Resource Lands:  • Removal of invasive and restoration of natural plant species.  • Enhancement or restoration of natural areas such as inland wetlands, forests, oak woodlands, mountain meadows, creeks, and streams with riparian or riverine fish or wildlife habitat, wildlife corridors and fish passages, coastal estuaries, grazing land and grasslands.  • Acquisitions in fee title or through conservation easements to safeguard regional water supplies, protect riparian and wildlife habitats, conserve agricultural lands for secure wildlife migration corridors, and provide public access for compatible wildlife/nature-oriented recreation by the wider community.  • Acquisitions to preserve in perpetuity Resource Lands for agricultural uses, open space, wetlands, biodiversity, etc.  Mitigation Projects Beyond the Scope of the Lead Agency:  Project examples listed under Urban Forestry and Resource Lands categories may be eligible for the Mitigation Projects Beyond the Scope of the Lead Agency category, if the mitigation or enhancement measures for the RTF were infeasible or beyond the jurisdiction and/or authority of the Lead Agency for the RTF.

of sufficient private investment that is available to successfully commercialize the output of research, development, and demonstration activities and bring innovative solar photovoltaic (PV) technology to market. \n\nSpecifically, projects funded through this NOFO will encourage innovations in solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing across the supply chain, with the aim of reducing U.S. reliance on imported materials and technologies. This NOFO also encourages the development of new solar hardware and technology for domestic use and potential export. These activities are expected to deliver jobs and economic growth in the clean energy sector, while increasing national energy security.\n\nTopic Area 1 seeks to conduct early-stage pilot-scale testing and demonstration of innovative processes or products that can substantively increase domestic manufacturing in all segments of the crystalline silicon solar module supply chain. Each segment also includes the manufacturing equipment used in that segment, input materials for that segment, process control and characterization tools, and consumables used in that segment, which today are predominantly made outside the United States.\n\nTopic Area 2 aims to support the cadmium telluride (CdTe) PV industry, an increasingly valuable part of the U.S. economy and leading domestic renewable energy technology. All segments of the CdTe PV module supply chain are of interest, including improvements in materials, processes, manufacturing, components, metrology, demonstration, recycling, and reclamation.\n\nTopic Area 3 is focused on R&D and demonstration activities with the goal of de-risking new non-module PV components and manufacturing processes, while developing and validating a realistic pathway to commercial success. This includes structural and electrical components and tools that can be made domestically and improve performance, functionality, reliability, or ease of installation for PV systems.", "agencyDetails": {"code": "GFO", "seed": "DOE-GFO", "agencyCode": "DOE-GFO", "agencyName": "Golden Field Office", "topAgencyCode": "DOE"}, "opportunityId": 358077, "applicantTypes": [{"id": "22", "description": "For profit organizations other than small businesses"}, {"id": "23", "description": "Small businesses"}], "archiveDateStr": "2025-06-29-00-00-00", "numberOfAwards": "10", "postingDateStr": "2025-01-08-00-00-00", "createTimeStamp": "Jan 08, 2025 11:33:37 AM EST", "lastUpdatedDate": "Jan 08, 2025 11:33:31 AM EST", "responseDateStr": "2025-05-30-00-00-00", "estimatedFunding": "20000000", "responseDateDesc": "", "topAgencyDetails": {"code": "DOE", "seed": "DOE", "agencyCode": "DOE", "agencyName": "Department of Energy", "topAgencyCode": "DOE"}, "agencyAddressDesc": "Click to email contact", "agencyContactDesc": "For questions regarding this NOFO: \nsolar.incubator@ee.doe.gov\n For questions regarding Exchange: \nEERE-eXCHANGESupport@hq.doe.gov", "agencyContactName": "Golden Field Office", "agencyContactEmail": "solar.incubator@ee.doe.gov", "agencyContactPhone": "202 287-1878", "createTimeStampStr": "2025-01-08-11-33-37", "fundingDescLinkUrl": "https://eere-exchange.energy.gov/Default.aspx#FoaIdfe9cde0d-e5d0-440a-805a-b83965617735", "fundingInstruments": [{"id": "CA", "description": "Cooperative Agreement"}], "awardFloorFormatted": "1,000,000", "fundingDescLinkDesc": "EERE Funding Opportunity Exchange", "awardCeilingFormatted": "4,000,000", "agencyContactEmailDesc": "Click to email contact", "applicantEligibilityDesc": "", "estimatedFundingFormatted": "20,000,000", "fundingActivityCategories": [{"id": "EN", "description": "Energy"}]}, "assistURL": "", "draftMode": "N", "_rawSample": true, "_sampleType": "detail_response", "relatedOpps": [], "_sampleIndex": 1, "publisherUid": "goadmin", "agencyDetails": {"code": "GFO", "seed": "DOE-GFO", "agencyCode": "DOE-GFO", "agencyName": "Golden Field Office", "topAgencyCode": "DOE"}, "errorMessages": [], "opportunityPkgs": [], "originalDueDate": "May 30, 2025 12:00:00 AM EDT", "assistCompatible": false, "opportunityTitle": "Fiscal Year 2025 Solar Module and Solar Hardware (SMASH) Incubator", "owningAgencyCode": "DOE-GFO", "topAgencyDetails": {"code": "DOE", "seed": "DOE", "agencyCode": "DOE", "agencyName": "Department of Energy", "topAgencyCode": "DOE"}, "forecastHistCount": 0, "opportunityNumber": "DE-FOA-0003460", "synPostDateInPast": true, "synopsisHistCount": 0, "opportunityCategory": {"category": "D", "description": "Discretionary"}, "originalDueDateDesc": "", "synAttChangeComments": [], "synopsisDocumentURLs": [], "closedOpportunityPkgs": [], "forecastModifiedFields": [], "synopsisModifiedFields": [], "opportunityHistoryDetails": [], "synopsisAttachmentFolders": [{"id": 76685, "folderName": "DE-FOA-0003460 (BASE)", "folderType": "Full Announcement", "zipLobSize": 1526579, "createdDate": "Jan 08, 2025 11:33:35 AM EST", "opportunityId": 358077, "lastUpdatedDate": "Jan 08, 2025 11:33:37 AM EST", "synopsisAttachments": [{"id": 345945, "fileName": "DE-FOA-0003460 Solar Module and Solar Hardware (SMASH) Incubator.pdf", "mimeType": "application/octet-stream", "createdDate": "Jan 08, 2025 11:33:36 AM EST", "fileLobSize": 1686922, "opportunityId": 358077, "fileDescription": "DE-FOA-0003460 Solar Module and Solar Hardware (SMASH) Incubator", "synopsisAttFolderId": 76685}]}]}], "totalDetailCallTime": 757, "successfulDetailCalls": 2, "averageDetailResponseTime": 378.5, "opportunitiesRequiringDetails": 2}', '{"inputCount": 2, "tokenUsage": 0, "passedCount": 2, "chunkMetrics": [{"status": "success", "chunkIndex": 1, "passedCount": 1, "timeSeconds": "24.5", "processedOpportunities": 1}, {"status": "success", "chunkIndex": 2, "passedCount": 1, "timeSeconds": "21.9", "processedOpportunities": 1}], "rejectedCount": 0, "processingTime": 24466, "filterReasoning": "Single opportunity passed 7-point relevance threshold", "rejectionReasons": [], "rawFilteredSamples": [{"id": "353946", "url": "https://www.fedconnect.net", "tags": ["grant", "infrastructure", "carbon", "transportation", "energy"], "notes": "Total program funding of $500 million, with up to 5 potential awards", "title": "Bipartisan Infrastructure Law -
