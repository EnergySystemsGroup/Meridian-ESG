Northern Japan will play a significant role in whether Japan is able to achieve its ambitious climate change and decarbonization goals, and the prefectural government has made Zero Carbon Hokkaido a signature initiative – and youth involvement could help sustain momentum over time.\n\nAdditional Details: The Consulate invites proposals from academic institutions, engineers, scientists, NGOs, and individuals or groups at tech companies to execute a tech camp or hackathon on climate change preferably in 2022. The program can be online, in-person, or hybrid depending on the public health environment. The program is expected to be interactive under any type of formats above, and it will target university students in Northern Japan. Ideally, it will bring approximately 30 to 50 students, along with several mentors, to work together during the program.",
