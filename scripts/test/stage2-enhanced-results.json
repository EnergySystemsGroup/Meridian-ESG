          "description": "Proposition 68 recognizes the critical importance of recreation and tourism to California's economy and ecology and specifically directs funds to be used to support and expand recreation economies, opportunities, and access to outdoor recreation. Projects must fall within one of the following three focus areas to be considered for funding: 1. Build Climate Resilience: Support the planning, development, and maintenance of recreation and outdoor infrastructure that anticipates or adapts to increased use and pressure from climate change and visitors escaping extreme weather. Projects must clearly have multiple benefits, such as tourism as well as education, recreation infrastructure with water-quality benefits, or recreation with habitat protection. 2. Improve/Increase Access for All: Improve and/or increase access to nature, including for communities that have not traditionally had equitable access through grants which result in either the implementation or identification, prioritization, and preparation for capital improvement projects. Projects must clearly have multiple benefits, such as tourism as well as education, recreation infrastructure with water-quality benefits, or recreation with habitat protection. 3. Landscape-scale Assessments: Support landscape-scale partnerships to develop an assessment of landscape conditions and risks to recreational infrastructure and other assets. Projects must clearly have multiple benefits, such as tourism as well as education, recreation infrastructure with water-quality benefits, or recreation with habitat protection.\n\nPrimary Purpose: This Grant Program aims to support innovative efforts to enhance, promote, and develop sustainable recreation and tourism opportunities and increase access for all to public lands in the Sierra-Cascade region. Program goals include improving access to nature and outdoor recreation opportunities, reducing impacts of overuse on natural and cultural resources, and supporting the development of sustainable recreation economies.\n\nAdditional Details: To initiate consideration of a project, a project organizer should review the Grant Guidelines and Guidelines Companion Document and contact the appropriate SNC Area Representative. If it is determined that SNC will consider partnering on the project, the Area Representative will share the SNC Proposal Form with the organizer and assist in developing the project and completing the Proposal Form. Proposals will be accepted and reviewed on a rolling basis as long as funding is available. Recommendations may be made to the SNC Governing Board on a quarterly basis beginning in June 2026. First review of project proposals will begin December 2025.",

The ECI program promotes research that can shape the future of the nation's physical civil infrastructure and that can contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation, and hazards and disaster resilience.\n\nTypes of civil infrastructure considered include, but are not limited to:\n- Buildings\n- Residential construction\n- Earth and earth retaining structures\n- Components of flood protection systems\n- Water, waste disposal, and wastewater systems\n- Energy infrastructure (excluding nuclear)\n- Transportation systems (excluding pavements)\n\nProgram Summary: The ECI program supports research that advances knowledge on the behavior of physical civil infrastructure subjected to and interacting with the natural environment during construction; under service and long-term conditions, including increased demands due to climate change adaptation and other emerging stressors; and under conditions caused by single or multiple extreme hazard events.\n\nAdditional Details: The program supports both disciplinary and convergent research that can address the challenges of physical civil infrastructure to be resilient and sustainable over its service lifetime. Broader impacts include fostering community welfare for an equitable and prosperous nation and promoting environmentally friendly, circular economy policies.",

Northern Japan will play a significant role in whether Japan is able to achieve its ambitious climate change and decarbonization goals, and the prefectural government has made Zero Carbon Hokkaido a signature initiative – and youth involvement could help sustain momentum over time.\n\nProgram Details: The Consulate invites proposals from academic institutions, engineers, scientists, NGOs, and individuals or groups at tech companies to execute a tech camp or hackathon on climate change preferably in 2022. The program can be online, in-person, or hybrid depending on the public health environment. The program is expected to be interactive under any type of formats above, and it will target university students in Northern Japan. Ideally, it will bring approximately 30 to 50 students, along with several mentors, to work together during the program.\n\nAdditional Information: Applicants are encouraged to submit proposals following the attached program and using the program template provided to demonstrate the organizational capacity and budget estimates to support online and/or in-person program empowering youth in northern Japan to develop innovative ideas and skills for combatting climate change.\n\nParticipant Details: Expected participants will be university (and/or high school) students at schools in northern Japan (defined as Hokkaido, Aomori, Akita, Iwate, and/or Miyagi Prefectures).",
