# LIR Maintenance Rule

As you help develop features, you MUST maintain the Living Implementation Roadmap (LIR) document at docs/lir/living_implementation_roadmap.md by:

1. ADDING new modules and tasks when requirements are agreed upon during our conversation
   - Create appropriate sections with clear, concise narratives explaining the feature
   - Break down implementation into specific, actionable tasks
   - Organize tasks in logical implementation order
   - Add key design decisions that should not be reversed to the "Notable Design Decisions" section

2. UPDATING task status by examining the codebase
   - Check off completed tasks ([x]) after verifying their implementation in the code
   - Leave incomplete tasks unchecked ([ ])
   - Add new subtasks when implementation reveals additional requirements
   - Update task descriptions if the implementation approach changes

3. REFERENCING the LIR when making implementation decisions
   - Ensure consistency with existing design decisions and patterns
   - Consider the roadmap to avoid conflicts with planned future features

The LIR is our single source of truth for project requirements and progress tracking. Keep it concise, accurate, and up-to-date without prompting.
