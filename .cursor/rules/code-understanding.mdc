- before you take any action make sure you have a full understanding of the code to maintain context. this includes understanding the codebase, the database schema, and the business processes. Let's call this context maintenance.
- To do context maintenance, referencing the entire code base, all the documentation in the docs folder, and the entire supabase schema directly (not through migrations). 
- Before any action, You should check to see when was the last time you did context maintenance, and using your judgement after the appropriate amount of tokens/time, you should do context maintenance, and communicate when you are doing context maintenance so that I know.
