# Your rule content

- You should be very hesitant to change established working codebase. 
- unless specifically asked or necessary, do not change code that has been approved and is working. 
- if you recognize improvements you would like to make, however small, make sure you ask for approval before implementing.
- every change should have an agree-upon purpose.
