        "details": "PIPELINE OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY:\nCurrent inefficient flow: DataExtraction → Analysis → Filter → Storage (with duplicate detection)\nNew optimized flow: DataExtraction → EarlyDuplicateDetector → [New opportunities only] → Analysis → Filter → Storage\n\nDUPLICATE PROCESSING FLOW (CLARIFIED):\nWhen EarlyDuplicateDetector finds a duplicate:\n1. Check the 6 critical fields for changes (comparing API data vs DB data)\n2. If changes found: Update fields directly in database (with null protection)\n3. If no changes found: Skip entirely (no processing needed)\n4. NEVER send duplicates through Analysis or Filter stages\n\nPIPELINE BRANCHING LOGIC:\n- New opportunities → Continue to Analysis → Filter → Storage\n- Duplicates with changes → Direct database update (bypass Analysis/Filter)\n- Duplicates without changes → Skip entirely (bypass Analysis/Filter/Storage)\n- Stale review (90-day fallback) → Direct field comparison and update (bypass Analysis/Filter)\n\nThis maximizes token savings by ensuring duplicates never hit expensive LLM processing stages.\n\nKEY IMPLEMENTATION AREAS:\n1. Create EarlyDuplicateDetector module with ID + Title validation approach\n2. Extend database schema with api_updated_at timestamps\n3. Modify DataExtractionAgent to capture API timestamps\n4. Update ProcessCoordinatorV2 to implement pipeline branching logic\n5. Implement Critical Fields + Null Protection strategy with direct database updates\n6. Implement API-based freshness checks using updated_at timestamps with 90-day stale review logic\n7. Use existing technologies: Prisma ORM v4.15.0, PostgreSQL, fuzzyset.js v1.0.7 for fuzzy matching\n8. Maintain comprehensive metrics tracking and error handling with Winston v3.9.0\n9. Continue using TypeScript for code quality\n\nCRITICAL FIELDS + NULL PROTECTION STRATEGY:\nOnly update these 6 critical fields when processing duplicates:\n- title (prevents duplicate detection failures when APIs change titles)\n- minimumAward, maximumAward, totalFundingAvailable (business-critical amounts)\n- closeDate, openDate (timing-critical dates)\n\nRule: Never overwrite existing data with null values. Only update when API provides non-null data.\n\nID + TITLE VALIDATION APPROACH:\n1. Check for ID matches within same source (treat ID as hint, not guarantee)\n2. Validate ID matches with title similarity check (confirming same opportunity)\n3. Fall back to title-only matching if no valid ID match found\n\nSTALE REVIEW LOGIC (CLARIFIED):\n- Trigger Condition: Only when API provides NO api_updated_at timestamp\n- Threshold: 90 days since our last updated_at timestamp\n- Action: Direct field comparison and update (bypass Analysis/Filter)\n- Post-Review: Update updated_at to current timestamp to reset the 90-day clock\n- Purpose: Fallback mechanism for APIs that don't provide update timestamps\n\nFRESHNESS CHECK OUTCOMES (UPDATED):\n1. API has timestamp + newer → Direct field comparison and update (bypass pipeline)\n2. API has timestamp + same/older → Skip entirely\n3. API has NO timestamp + 90+ days old → Direct field comparison and update (bypass pipeline)\n4. API has NO timestamp + <90 days → Skip entirely\n\nOnly truly new opportunities go through the full Analysis and Filter pipeline.\n\nBUSINESS DECISIONS RESOLVED:\n- Manual admin edit protection: Critical Fields + Null Protection (simple, effective)\n- Stale review threshold: 90 days (prevents endless re-processing while ensuring periodic verification)\n- ID reliability: Use ID + Title validation instead of ID-first matching",

Test API timestamp capture and freshness checking logic with 4-scenario decision matrix\n6. Verify 90-day stale review threshold works correctly and bypasses pipeline stages\n7. Test ProcessCoordinatorV2 branching modifications\n8. Ensure direct database updates for duplicates don't break existing functionality\n9. Performance testing with large datasets to validate maximum optimization gains\n10. Integration tests for complete optimized pipeline with proper branching logic\n11. Regression testing to ensure existing Storage Agent V2 functionality is preserved\n12. Test stale review logic triggers direct updates and resets 90-day clock correctly\n13.

Analyzed current systematic scoring criteria with 5 components: projectTypeMatch (0-3), clientTypeMatch (0-3), categoryMatch (0-2), fundingThreshold (0-1), fundingType (0-1) totaling 10 points. Evaluating whether current weights are appropriate and considering additional criteria including competition level, application complexity, timeline feasibility, and geographic alignment to enhance scoring accuracy.\n</info added on 2025-06-18T03:59:47.612Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-18T04:46:05.809Z>\nApplied business context revision to code. Added 3 new subtasks to Task 3: 3.10) Update taxonomy with target client/project types, 3.11) Add eligible_activities field to DB and Data Extraction Agent, 3.12) Replace categoryMatch with activityMatch in scoring. Created Task 20 for client advantage analysis with database field and Data Extraction Agent integration. Ready to continue with systematic scoring refinement after these data structure updates are complete.\n</info added on 2025-06-18T04:46:05.809Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-21T21:42:59.131Z>\nCompleted systematic scoring refinement with new gating system implementation. Replaced 5-component scoring with streamlined 3-component gating system: clientProjectRelevance (0-6) with gating requirement, fundingAttractiveness (0-3) for financial assessment, and fundingType (0-1) grant bonus. Added dynamic taxonomy imports and gating logic requiring ≥2 for viability, ≥5 for auto-qualification. Updated prompt to reference actual field names and fixed metrics calculation. New system prevents irrelevant high-funding opportunities while auto-passing perfect matches, with 60% weighting on business relevance. System ready for testing or proceeding to schema review.\n</info added on 2025-06-21T21:42:59.131Z>",

Database Migration Applied: Added enhanced_description (TEXT) and scoring (JSONB) fields to funding_opportunities table\n2. Schema Alignment Fixed: \n   - Updated opportunityAnalysis schema to match database fields exactly\n   - Renamed scoringExplanation → relevanceReasoning (matches DB field)\n   - Kept scoring object in schema (will map to JSONB in storage)\n   - Updated field descriptions for natural language approach\n3. Analysis Agent Updated: \n   - Now uses centralized schemas.opportunityAnalysis instead of inline schema\n   - Updated error handling to use relevanceReasoning field name\n   - Simplified response processing since LLM returns complete objects\n\nSTORAGE MAPPING PLAN (Next Step):\n- scoring.overallScore → relevance_score (for backward compatibility)\n- scoring object → scoring JSONB field (new)\n- relevanceReasoning → relevance_reasoning (direct match)\n- enhancedDescription → enhanced_description (direct match)\n\nThis ensures Analysis Agent output perfectly matches database structure while preserving full scoring object for analysis.\n</info added on 2025-06-21T23:41:18.096Z>",
